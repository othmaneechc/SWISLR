0,Rapid deforestation of a coastal landscape driven by sea level rise andextreme events,"Ury, Emily A; Yang, Xi; Wright, Justin P; Bernhardt, Emily S","Climate change is driving ecological shifts in coastal regions of theworld, where low topographic relief makes ecosystems particularlyvulnerable to sea level rise, salinization, storm surge, and other effectsof global climate change. The consequences of rising water tables andsalinity can penetrate well inland, and lead to particularly dramaticchanges in freshwater forested wetlands dominated by tree species with lowsalt tolerance. The resulting loss of coastal forests could havesignificant implications to the coastal carbon cycle. We quantified therates of vegetation change including land loss, forest loss and shrublandexpansion in North Carolina's largest coastal wildlife refuge over 35years. Despite its protected status, and in the absence of any activeforest management, 32 % (31,600 hectares) of the refuge area has changedlandcover classification during the study period. A total of 1151 hectaresof land was lost to the sea and ~19,300 hectares of coastal forest habitatwas converted to shrubland or marsh habitat. As much as 11 % of allforested cover in the refuge transitioned to a unique land cover type -'ghost forest' - characterized by standing dead trees and fallen treetrunks. The formation of this 'ghost forest' transition state peakedprominently between 2011 and 2012, following Hurricane Irene and afive-year drought, with 4,500 ± 990 hectares of ghost forest formingduring that year alone. This is the first attempt to map and quantitycoastal ghost forests using remote sensing. Forest losses were greatest inthe eastern portion of the refuge closest to the Croatan and PamlicoSounds, but also occurred much further inland in low elevation areas andalongside major canals. These unprecedented rates of deforestation andland cover change due to climate change may become the status quo forcoastal regions worldwide, with implications for wetland function,wildlife habitat and global carbon cycling.",2021,,Ecol.

1,Estuaries of the Northeastern United States: Habitat and Land UseSignatures,"Roman, Charles T; Jaworski, Norbert; Short, Frederick T; Findlay, Stuart; Warren, R Scott","Geographic signatures are physical, chemical, biotic, and human-inducedcharacteristics or processes that help define similar or unique featuresof estuaries along latitudinal or geographic gradients.Geomorphologically, estuaries of the northeastern U.S., from the HudsonRiver estuary and northward along the Gulf of Maine shoreline, are highlydiverse because of a complex bedrock geology and glacial history.Back-barrier estuaries and lagoons occur within the northeast region, butthe domiant type is the drowned-river valley, often with rocky shores.Tidal range and mean depth of northeast estuaries are generally greaterwhen compared to estuaries of the more southern U.S. Atlantic coast andGulf of Mexico. Because of small estuarine drainage basins, low riverineflows, a bedrock substrate, and dense forest cover, sediment loads innortheast estuaries are generally quite low and water clarity is high.Tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, intertidal mudflats, and rocky shoresrepresent major habitat types that fringe northeast estuaries, supportingcommercially-important fauna, forage nekton and benthos, and coastal birdcommunities, while also serving as links between deeper estuarine watersand habitats through detritus-based pathways. Regarding land use and waterquality trends, portions of the northeast have a history of over a centuryof intense urbanization as reflected in increased total nitrogen and totalphosphorus loadings to estuaries, with wastewater treatment facilities andatmospheric deposition being major sources. Agricultural inputs arerelatively minor throughout the northeast, with relative importanceincreasing for coastal plain estuaries. Identifying geographic signaturesprovides an objective means for comparing the structure, function, andprocesses of estuaries along latitudinal gradients.",2000,,,23,,,,,,#6,Roman 2000,,

This transgression is acomplex process regulated by infrequent storms that flood uplandecosystems increasing soil salinity. As a result upland vegetation isreplaced by halophyte marsh plants. Here we present a review of the mainprocesses and feedbacks regulating the transition from upland ecosystemsto salt marshes. The goal is to provide a process-based framework thatenables the development of quantitative models for the dynamics of themarsh-upland boundary.

3,"Salt Marsh Mosquito-Control Ditches: Sedimentation, Landscape Change, andRestoration Implications","Corman, Sarah S; Roman, Charles T; King, John W; Appleby, Peter G","Mosquito ditches are a prolific physical feature of Atlantic coast saltmarshes, dug most intensely since the 1930s to control the breeding ofsalt marsh mosquitoes. Removal of ditches by filling or other methods isunder consideration as a restoration alternative at a Fire Island, NewYork, salt marsh. This study evaluated sediment dynamics and marshlandscape structure of the ditched marsh, thereby providing information tobetter support efforts to predict marsh responses to restorationalternatives. Field surveys, historic and recent aerial photographyanalysis, and radiometric dating techniques were used. The estimatedaverage natural sedimentation rate within the ditches was 0.52 cm y -1 , arate greater than the accretion rate of the adjacent marsh surface. Theaverage time for a Fire Island ditch to naturally fill would be 175 yearsfrom present, but spatially this is highly variable, with some ditchescompletely filled and others showing no evidence of natural filling.Active filling of ditches may be a feasible restoration alternative,pending the findings of pilot studies, but given concerns for marshsubmergence with accelerated rates of sea level rise, restoration designshould provide a hydrologic network to facilitate adequate marsh drainage.\textcopyright 2012 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.",2012,,J.

5,Uncovering climate (in)justice with an adaptive capacity assessment: Amultiple case study in rural coastal North Carolina,"Jurjonas, Matthew; Seekamp, Erin; Rivers, Louie; Cutts, Bethany","Climate change resilience is an area of praxis where efforts to enhancecommunity adaptive capacity are informed by theory. However, there isgrowing evidence that ethnocentrism and privilege are shaping coastalmanagement policies while many communities with climate justice issuesstruggle to build resilience. Particularly, rural coastal communities,contrasting urban areas, have limited access to centralized planningefforts, unique local contexts for outreach, compounding socialvulnerabilities (job loss, out-migration, limited social services), andreceive less attention from resilience researchers. Following calls tointegrate climate justice into resilience praxis, we assess perceptions ofadaptive capacity within predominately African American communities in arural low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. We add a climatejustice lens to evaluate the previously-validated Rural Coastal CommunityResilience (RCCR) framework. The RCCR is intended to improve planningefforts by providing climate change information, initiating conversations,and contributing to resilience theory. In contrast to its previousapplications, engagement led to declines in perceived adaptive capacity.This result highlights that the information sharing goals of theengagement efforts were poorly aligned with community concerns and threatperceptions. Additionally, perceived climate injustices emerged revealinginstances of adaptation oppression. This study recommends strategies torethink traditional extension efforts to improve inclusiveness by deeplyinterrogating the inherent whiteness of standard modes of communicatingclimate science.",2020,,Land use policy,94,,104547,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104547,,#17,Jurjonas 2020,,
6,Can Saltwater Intrusion Accelerate Nutrient Export from Freshwater WetlandSoils? An Experimental Approach,"Steinmuller, Havalend E; Chambers, Lisa G","\textcopyright Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., MadisonWI 53711 USA. All Rights reserved. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable tosaltwater intrusion, which may alter soil biogeochemical processes, leadto the export of nutrients into the coastal zone, and contribute toeutrophication. Using intact soil cores from three different freshwaterwetlands and subjecting them to control (0), 5, or 15 parts per thousand(ppt) seawater treatments, we investigated how different wetland soils(bayhead swamp, cypress dome, and mineral marsh) and salinities alter theexport of soil nutrients [soluble reactive P (SRP), NH 4 +, and dissolvedorganic C (DOC)], as well as microbial biomass C and greenhouse gasemissions. The highest salinity treatment increased CO 2 production by 30%with no change in methane production. Porewater NH 4 + concentrationsaveraged 8× higher than the control in the 15-ppt treatment and 5× greaterthan the control in the 5-ppt treatment, with a \ 1-wk lag period betweenporewater accumulation of NH 4 + and export into the surrounding water.The magnitude of NH 4 + export was mediated by wetland soil type. Solublereactive P concentrations averaged 8× and 3.5× higher in the cypress domeand bayhead swamp 15-ppt treatments respectively than in their controls,though no effect was observed within the mineral marsh. Dissolved organicC concentrations differed by wetland soil type but were unaffected bysalinity treatment. This study demonstrates that saltwater intrusion couldcatalyze the rapid export of nutrients from freshwater wetland soils intothe coastal zone, though nutrient export varies by wetland soil type.",2018,,Soil Sci.

7,Present and future sea level rise at the intersection of race and povertyin the Carolinas: A geospatial analysis,"Handwerger, Leah R; Sugg, Margaret M; Runkle, Jennifer D","Sea level rise (SLR) has and will continue to impact coastal communitiesin the coming decades. Despite the widespread availability of data on SLRprojections, little is known about the differential impact of SLR onminority or economically disadvantaged populations. In this study, we aimto identify the geographic areas in which low-income and communities ofcolor along the North and South Carolina coastline in the United Stateswill experience the most severe effects of SLR. Geospatial mapping wasperformed to estimate the total area impacted by 1) SLR, 2) tidalinundation, and 3) low-lying areas separately for three scenarios (0-, 2-,and 4-feet). Findings project that over 2.2 million people and at least370,000 Black or economically disadvantaged individuals will be impactedby SLR by 2100. Results showed that the most economically deprived andracially segregated communities are already experiencing the effects ofSLR, including more frequent tidal inundation and low-lying flooding.Inland flooding is seven times more likely to occur in low-income Blackcommunities compared to high-income white communities. Findings highlightthe urgent need for additional resources and adaptive measures that targetlow-income, black communities who will continue to be disproportionatelyimpacted by SLR in coastal Carolina.",2021,,The Journal of Climate Change and Health,3,,100028,,10.1016/j.joclim.2021.100028,,#27,Handwerger 2021,,
8,Potential increase in coastal wetland vulnerability to sea-level risesuggested by considering hydrodynamic attenuation effects,"Rodríguez, José F; Saco, Patricia M; Sandi, Steven; Saintilan, Neil; Riccardi, Gerardo","The future of coastal wetlands and their ecological value depend on theircapacity to adapt to the interacting effects of human impacts andsea-level rise. Even though extensive wetland loss due to submergence is apossible scenario, its magnitude is highly uncertain due to limitedunderstanding of hydrodynamic and bio-geomorphic interactions over time.In particular, the effect of man-made drainage modifications onhydrodynamic attenuation and consequent wetland evolution is poorlyunderstood. Predictions are further complicated by the presence of anumber of vegetation types that change over time and also contribute toflow attenuation. Here, we show that flow attenuation affects wetlandvegetation by modifying its wetting-drying regime and inundation depth,increasing its vulnerability to sea-level rise. Our simulations for anAustralian subtropical wetland predict much faster wetland loss thancommonly used models that do not consider flow attenuation.",2017,,Nat.

9,Model of Marsh Erosion and Migration,"Kirwan, Matthew L; Walters, David C; Reay, William G; Carr, Joel A","Coastal wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, whereecosystem services such as flood protection depend nonlinearly on wetlandsize and are threatened by sea level rise and coastal development. Here,we propose a simple model of marsh migration into adjacent uplands, andcouple it with existing models of seaward edge erosion and vertical soilaccretion to explore how ecosystem connectivity influences marsh size andresponse to sea level rise. We find that marsh loss is nearly inevitablewhere topographic and anthropogenic barriers limit migration. Whereunconstrained by barriers, however, rates of marsh migration are much moresensitive to accelerated sea level rise than rates of edge erosion. Thisbehavior suggests a counterintuitive, natural tendency for marsh expansionwith sea level rise, and emphasizes the disparity between coastal responseto climate change with and without human intervention.",2016,,Geophys.

10,Influence of artificial channels on the source and extent of saline waterintrusion in the wind tide dominated wetlands of the southern Albemarleestuarine system (USA),"Manda, Alex K; Giuliano, Angela S; Allen, Thomas R","Saline water intrusion is degrading water quality in the channelizedcoastal wetlands of the southern Albemarle estuarine system (AES). Thesource, transport and fate of the saline water in the southern AES wasdetermined by monitoring specific conductivity and water levels in smallartificial channels, the Alligator River, the Alligator–Pungo Canal andthe groundwater system for ~12 months. Results indicate that water levelsare affected by wind tides which trigger the movement of saline water intothe interior of the wetlands via the small canals. The wind tides aremostly driven by episodic southerly winds pushing saline water into thecanal network and the groundwater regime proximal to the Alligator River.The saline waters persist in the canals as long as the wind tide eventslast. Specific conductivities from canals and groundwater are shown to beunexpectedly higher closer to the source of the Alligator River thantoward the Albemarle Sound, suggesting that the large Alligator–PungoCanal facilitates the northward migration of saline water from the PamlicoSound to the Alligator River. Overwash and reversals in the flowdirections between groundwater and surface water bodies suggest thatsaline water that is present during wind tide events may migrate into thegroundwater system from surface water bodies. The results of this studyreveal that whereas the large Alligator–Pungo Canal channels saline waterto the AES, small artificial channels may also play significant roles indegrading water quality in the interior of channelized coastal wetlands.",2014,,Environ.

11,Differential effects of chronic and acute simulated seawater intrusion ontidal freshwater marsh carbon cycling,"Herbert, Ellen R; Schubauer-Berigan, Joseph; Craft, Christopher B","Tidal freshwater ecosystems experience acute seawater intrusion associatedwith periodic droughts, but are expected to become chronically salinizedas sea level rises. Here we report the results from an experimentalmanipulation in a tidal freshwater Zizaniopsis miliacea marsh on theAltamaha River, GA where diluted seawater was added to replicate marshplots on either a press (constant) or pulse (2 months per year) basis. Wemeasured changes in porewater chemistry (SO4 2-, Cl-, organic C, inorganicnitrogen and phosphorus), ecosystem CO2 and CH4 exchange, and microbialextracellular enzyme activity. We found that press (chronic) seawateradditions increased porewater chloride and sulfate almost immediately, andammonium and phosphate after 2-4 months. Chronic increases in salinityalso decreased net ecosystem exchange, resulting in reduced CO2 and CH4emissions from press plots. Our pulse treatment, designed to mimic naturalsalinity incursion in the Altamaha River (September and October),temporarily increased porewater ammonium concentrations but had fewlasting effects on porewater chemistry or ecosystem carbon balance. Ourfindings suggest that long-term, chronic saltwater intrusion will lead toreduced C fixation and the potential for increased nutrient (N, P) exportwhile acute pulses of saltwater will have temporary effects.",2018,,Biogeochemistry,138,2,137-154,,10.1007/s10533-018-0436-z,,#42,Herbert 2018,,

13,Watershed land use and river engineering drive wetland formation and lossin the Mississippi river birdfoot delta,"Tweel, Andrew W; Eugene Turner, R","The Mississippi River basin was developed for agriculture at anunprecedented scale and intensity within the last 200 yr. These changesfavored erosion and sediment transport, which were subsequently reduced bysoil conservation practices, the trapping of sediment behind largereservoirs, and channel engineering. We discuss the relationship betweensediment loading and the growth, loss, and stability of wetlands in theMississippi River birdfoot delta (MRBD). We report an anthropogenicallydriven increase in mean suspended sediment concentrations in theMississippi River below New Orleans, from a modeled 350 mg L21 (174 3 109kg yr21) at the end of the 18th century to a measured maximum of 675 mgL21 (3483109 kg yr21) in the late 19th century, followed by a sharpreduction, and then a period of stabilization at 157 mg L21 (91 3 109 kgyr21) after 1962. Changes in wetland area of the MRBD over the past twocenturies reflect variations in sediment supply during periods ofincreasing, decreasing, and stable sediment loading, and are distinct fromwetland loss patterns in other areas of coastal Louisiana. The rapidgrowth of the MRBDuntil the 1930s, which has been used as a reference forone of the world's largest wetland restoration efforts, may not be asuitable archetype for the majority of the coast. Additionally, futurevariation in sediment supply to the MRBD would likely change the totalwetland area of the MRBD. Intensive",2012,,Limnol.

14,Soils in transition: saltwater intrusion alters soil chemistry inagricultural fields,"Tully, Katherine L; Weissman, Danielle; Wyner, W Jesse; Miller, Jarrod; Jordan, Thomas","As global sea-levels rise, low-lying coastal lands are subject to shallowcoastal flooding and saltwater intrusion, affecting the productivity offarmlands worldwide. Soil biogeochemistry can be dramatically altered assaltwater intrudes agricultural fields. We selected three farm fields inSomerset Co., Maryland affected by saltwater intrusion and establishedtransects from the ditch bank to the center of the cropped field andcollected soils (to ~ 140 cm) at five points along this transect. Thethree fields in this study have different soil types, are located alongdifferent tributaries in the county, and receive different fertilizerrates, yet they all showed similar biogeochemical responses to saltwaterintrusion. We found an increase in electrical conductivity andconcentrations of chloride, sulfate, and forms of phosphorus (P) from thecenter of the field (low) to the ditch banks (high). As inundationincreased, the structure of iron (Fe) changed from crystalline tonon-crystalline forms, possibly due to dissolution under saturatedconditions. Near the edges of the fields, the formation of organometalliccomplexes was positively associated with increases in soil carbon andorganic soil P concentrations. Compared to areas of the fields where cropswere actively growing, soil P concentrations are 2–3 higher on fieldedges, suggesting that saltwater intrusion may be transporting P to theedges of agricultural fields. These field edges are frequently saturated,thus reduction of Fe could lead to P release into solution potentiallyharming water quality. As climate change pushes saltwater further inland,it is important to understand the biogeochemical consequences forecosystems up- and downstream. Understanding the how fractions of P moveand change across fields affected by saltwater intrusion will be crucialfor planning current and future management of coastal agricultural lands.",2019,,Biogeochemistry,142,3,339-356,,10.1007/s10533-019-00538-9,,#47,Tully 2019,,

18,Mitigating the Expansion of Harmful Algal Blooms Across theFreshwater-to-Marine Continuum,"Paerl, Hans W; Otten, Timothy G; Kudela, Raphael","Anthropogenic nutrient overenrichment, coupled with rising temperatures,and an increasing frequency of extreme hydrologic events (storms anddroughts) are accelerating eutrophication and promoting the expansion ofharmful algal blooms (HABs) across the freshwater-to-marine continuum. AllHABs—with a focus here on cyanobacterial blooms—pose serious consequencesfor water supplies, fisheries, recreational uses, tourism, and propertyvalues. As nutrient loads grow in watersheds, they begin to compound theeffects of legacy stores. This has led to a paradigm shift in ourunderstanding of how nutrients control eutrophication and blooms.Phosphorus (P) reductions have been traditionally prescribed exclusivelyfor freshwater systems, while nitrogen (N) reductions were mainly stressedfor brackish and coastal waters.

The effects of dredging on tidal range andsaltwater intrusion in the Pearl River estuary. A dredging project in thePearl River estuary would influence the topography, water dynamics, andmass transport process. The effects of dredging in the channel of thePearl River estuary on tidal range and saltwater intrusion were studiedusing a hydrodynamic model (finite volume coastal ocean model) andhistorical water depth data. The measured data showed that the tidal rangedecreased and saltwater intrusion increased in the North River. The tidalrange increased and saltwater intrusion decreased in the West River inrecent decades from the 1980s. The simulations in this study showed thatafter dredging (1) the upstream flow split ratio in the river changed(i.e. more freshwater flowed through the Sanshui station), whereas lessfreshwater flowed through the Makou station; (2) the tidal range increasedin the West River network and decreased in the downstream reaches of theNorth River network; and (3) the saltwater intrusion increased in the WestRiver mouths and weakened in the North River mouths. These results agreedwith the observed phenomenon. The change in the flow split ratio betweenthe North River and the West River induced by dredging was the fundamentaldynamic that caused changes in both the tidal range and saltwaterintrusion in the Pearl River estuary.

25,Evolutionary history influences the salinity preference of bacterial taxain wetland soils,"Morrissey, Ember M; Franklin, Rima B","Salinity is a major driver of bacterial community composition across theglobe. Despite growing recognition that different bacterial species arepresent or active at different salinities, the mechanisms by whichsalinity structures community composition remain unclear. We tested thehypothesis that these patterns reflect ecological coherence in thesalinity preferences of phylogenetic groups using a reciprocal transplantexperiment of fresh- and saltwater wetland soils. The salinity of both theorigin and host environments affected community composition (16S rRNA genesequences) and activity (CO2 and CH4 production, and extracellular enzymeactivity). These changes in community composition and activity rates werestrongly correlated, which suggests the effect of environment on functioncould be mediated, at least in part, by microbial community composition.Based on their distribution across treatments, each phylotype wascategorized as having a salinity preference (freshwater, saltwater, ornone) and phylogenetic analyses revealed a significant influence ofevolutionary history on these groupings. This finding was corroborated byexamining the salinity preferences of high-level taxonomic groups. Forinstance, we found that the majority of α- and γ-proteobacteria in thesewetland soils preferred saltwater, while many β-proteobacteria preferfreshwater. Overall, our results indicate the effect of salinity onbacterial community composition results from phylogenetically-clusteredsalinity preferences.",2015,,Front.

26,Multiple States in the Sea-Level Induced Transition from TerrestrialForest to Estuary,"Brinson, Mark M; Christian, Robert R; Blum, Linda K","[In this paper we provide a conceptual model to examine changes inecosystem state during the transition from terrestrial forest to shallowestuarine environments for coastal mainland marshes at the Virginia CoastReserve (VCR), United States of America. Ecosystem states arecharacterized by plant community dominants and soil/sedimentcharacteristics. The five states considered are upland or wetland forest,organic high marsh, intertidal mineral low marsh, autotrophic benthic withor without submersed aquatic vascular plants, and heterotrophic benthic(estuarine bottom). Transitions between states are described from theperspective of a fixed forest location undergoing transition from oneecosystem state to another. Rising sea level is acknowledged as the mastervariable that forces the process of change overall. Each state ishypothesized to have self-maintaining properties and thus is resistant tochange from rising sea level; alternatively, transitions between statesare facilitated by disturbance or exposure to acute stress. For change tooccur, resistance must be overcome by events that are more abrupt thanrising sea level and that appear as accentuated pulsings, which result inanother self-maintaining and resistant state. Such events facilitate plantspecies replacement and alter sediment conditions.

Not surprisingly, many of the geographicalregions that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change are alsothe traditional lands of indigenous communities. This article takes theposition that the adaptation strategy will prove genocidal for many groupsof indigenous people, and instead argues for recognition of an indigenousright to environmental self-determination, which would allow indigenouspeoples to maintain their cultural and political status upon theirtraditional lands. In the context of climate change policy, such a rightwould impose affirmative requirements on nation-states to engage in amitigation strategy in order to avoid catastrophic harm to indigenouspeoples. This article argues for a new conception of rights to address theunique harms of climate change. An indigenous right to environmentalself-determination would be based on human rights norms in recognitionthat ""sovereignty claims"" by indigenous groups are not a sufficient basisto protect traditional ways of life and the rich and unique cultural normsof such groups. Similarly, tort-based theories of compensation for theharms of climate change have only limited capacity to address the concernsof indigenous peoples.",2007,,Univ. Colo.

29,A multiple knowledge approach for adaptation to environmental change:lessons learned from coastal Louisiana's tribal communities,"Maldonado, Julie Koppel","\textlessp\textgreaterEnvironmental changes, such as sea level rise, areforcibly displacing communities around the world. Forced displacement,inadequate governance mechanisms to address relocation and economic-basedadaptation and restoration efforts are leading to devastating social,cultural, health, and economic consequences for the people and communitiesaffected. This article focuses on three tribal communities in coastalLouisiana that are experiencing rapid environmental change and risk ofdisplacement due to historical discriminatory processes, oil anddam-related development projects, oil disasters, increased exposure tohurricanes, and relative sea level rise. Focusing on the political ecologyof the communities' experiences of environmental change, including theimpacts of displacement and decisions to stay in-place vs. relocate, thispaper addresses broader issues of adaptive governance structures andpolicy implications. Building on Bronen's (2011) rights-based approach toadaptation and Shearer's (2012) approach to a political ecology ofadaptation, I argue that governance structures should be put in place thatsupport communities' in-situ adaptation efforts or, if the communitydecides its current location is no longer inhabitable, to assistcommunity-led relocation efforts. Multiple forms of knowledge should beincorporated into and should inform the structures supporting theadaptation process. I highlight the social, political, environmental andeconomic context within which environmental changes are occurring incoastal Louisiana through discussion on the loss of the commons, thecreation of an energy sacrifice zone, costbenefit based restorationefforts and forced displacement and relocation.Key words: Environmentalchange, displacement, relocation, adaptation\textless/p\textgreater",2014,,J.

The effects of saltwater pulses on belowgroundprocessing rates of detrital organic matter as mediated by microbialactivities are uncertain. Our objectives were to quantify whether and howpulses of saltwater (i) change soil porewater physicochemistry, (ii)change soil microbial extracellular enzyme activities, and (iii) changeroot litter breakdown over time in freshwater and brackish marshes. From2014 to 2016, we simulated saltwater intrusion as monthly in situ pulsedadditions of artificial seawater in experimental dosing chambers (1.4 mdiameter) within freshwater and brackish marshes of Everglades NationalPark. At monthly intervals, we collected soil porewater chemistry, andmeasured microbial extracellular enzymes, elemental stoichiometric ratios,and breakdown rates (k) of incubated (0–30 cm depth) root litter andcompared these responses over time. Saltwater pulses increased sulfate andnitrogen concentrations in porewater at the freshwater site. However,saltwater pulses generally decreased porewater constituents (e.g.,dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus species) atthe brackish site. One saltwater pulse increased root litter k by1.25-fold in the brackish marsh. However, long-term (740 days) k inbrackish wetlands, and both short- and long-term k in freshwater wetlands,were not affected by 24 monthly pulses of saltwater.

Contemporary deposition (artificial marker horizon, 3.5 years)and long-term accumulation rates (210Pb profiles, \ 150 years) of sedimentand associated carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were measuredin wetlands along the tidal Savannah and Waccamaw rivers in thesoutheastern USA. Four sites along each river spanned anupstream-to-downstream salinification gradient, from upriver tidalfreshwater forested wetland (TFFW), through moderately and highlysalt-impacted forested wetlands, to oligohaline marsh downriver.Contemporary deposition rates (sediment, C, N, and P) were greatest inoligohaline marsh and lowest in TFFW along both rivers. Greater rates ofdeposition in oligohaline and salt-stressed forested wetlands wereassociated with a shift to greater clay and metal content that is likelyassociated with a change from low availability of watershed-derivedsediment to TFFW and to greater availability of a coastal sediment sourceto oligohaline wetlands. Long-term accumulation rates along the WaccamawRiver had the opposite spatial pattern compared to contemporarydeposition, with greater rates in TFFW that declined to oligohaline marsh.Long-term sediment and elemental mass accumulation rates also were 3–9×lower than contemporary deposition rates. In comparison to other studies,sediment and associated nutrient accumulation in TFFW are lower thandownriver/estuarine freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marshes, suggestinga reduced capacity for surface sedimentation (short-term) as well asshallow soil processes (long-term sedimentation) to offset sea level risein TFFW.

32,"Assessing impacts of climate change, sea level rise, and drainage canalson saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifer","Rasmussen, P; Sonnenborg, T O; Goncear, G; Hinsby, K","Groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is vulnerable to climatechange and sea level rise because both may potentially impact saltwaterintrusion and hence groundwater quality depending on the hydrogeologicalsetting. In the present study the impacts of sea level rise and changes ingroundwater recharge are quantified for an island located in the WesternBaltic Sea. The low-lying central area of the investigated part of theisland was extensively drained and reclaimed during the second half of the19th century by a system of artificial drainage canals that significantlyaffects the flow dynamics of the area. The drinking water, mainly forsummer cottages, is abstracted from 11 wells drilled to a depth of around20 m into the upper 5-10 m of a confined chalk aquifer, and the totalpumping is only 5-6 % of the drainage pumping. Increasing chlorideconcentrations have been observed in several abstraction wells and in somecases the WHO drinking water standard has been exceeded. Using themodeling package MODFLOW/MT3D/SEAWAT the historical, present and futurefreshwater-sea water distribution is simulated. The model is calibratedagainst hydraulic head observations and validated against geochemical andgeophysical data from new investigation wells, including borehole logs,and from an airborne transient electromagnetic survey. The impact ofclimate changes on saltwater intrusion is found to be sensitive to theboundary conditions of the investigated system. For the flux-controlledaquifer to the west of the drained area only changes in groundwaterrecharge impacts the freshwater-sea water interface whereas sea level risedoes not result in increasing sea water intrusion. However, on the barrierislands to the east of the reclaimed area, below which the sea ishydraulically connected to the drainage canals, and the boundary of theflow system therefore controlled, the projected changes in sea level,groundwater recharge and stage of the drainage canals all have significantimpacts on saltwater intrusion and the chloride concentrations found inabstraction wells.",2013,,Hydrol.

34,Declines in plant productivity drive loss of soil elevation in a tidalfreshwater marsh exposed to saltwater intrusion,"Solohin, Elena; Widney, Sarah E; Craft, Christopher B","We experimentally increased salinities in a tidal freshwater marsh on theAltamaha River (Georgia, USA) by exposing the organic rich soils to 3.5 yrof continuous (press) and episodic (pulse) treatments with dilute seawaterto simulate the effects of climate change such as sea level rise (press)and drought (pulse). We quantified changes in root production anddecomposition, soil elevation, and soil C stocks in replicated (n = 6) 2.5× 2.5 m field plots. Elevated salinity had no effect on rootdecomposition, but it caused a significant reduction in root productionand belowground biomass that is needed to build and maintain soilelevation capital. The lack of carbon inputs from root production resultedin reduced belowground biomass of 1631 ± 308 vs. 2964 ± 204 g/m2 incontrol plots and an overall 2.8 ± 0.9 cm decline in soil surfaceelevation in the press plots in the first 3.5 yr, whereas the control (nobrackish water additions) and the fresh (river water only) treatmentsgained 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.7 ± 0.3 cm, respectively, in a 3.5-yr period. Therewas no change in elevation of pulse plots after 3.5 yr. Based onmeasurements of bulk density and soil C, the decline of 2.8 cm of surfaceelevation resulted in a loss of 0.77 ± 0.5 kg C/m2 in press plots. Incontrast, the control and the fresh treatment plots gained 0.25 ± 0.04 and0.36 ± 0.03 kg C/m2, respectively, which represents a net change in Cstorage of more than 1 kg C/m2. We conclude that, when continuouslyexposed to saltwater intrusion, the tidal freshwater marsh's net primaryproductivity, especially root production, and not decomposition, are themain drivers of soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Reducedproductivity leads to loss of soil elevation and soil C, which hasimportant implications for tidal freshwater marsh persistence in the faceof rising sea level.",2020,,Ecology,101,12,e03148,,10.1002/ecy.3148,,#91,Solohin 2020,,

At the same time, they are moredensely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates ofpopulation growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continueinto the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affectedby such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060.Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assessfuture population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends inexposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level andsocio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth ofcoastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends ofurbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but doesnot explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due tofactors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates ofthe baseline population with demographic data in order to derivescenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Ourscenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevationcoastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India,Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest totalcoastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking isexpected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa isexpected to experience the highest rates of population growth andurbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharancountries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countriesand regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and helpidentifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for buildingresilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential.Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope forimprovement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.",2015,,PLoS One,10,3,e0118571,,10.1371/journal.pone.0118571,,#93,Neumann 2015,,
36,Nonlinear Dynamics and Alternative Stable States in Shallow CoastalSystems,"McGlathery, Karen; Reidenbach, Matthew; D'Odorico, Paolo; Fagherazzi, Sergio; Pace, Michael; Porter, John","The dynamics of shallow-water coastal environments are controlled byexternal drivers-sea level rise, storms, and sediment and nutrientsupplies-and by internal feedbacks. Interactions of biotic processes(vegetation growth, trophic dynamics) and abiotic drivers can lead tononlinear responses to changing conditions and to the emergence ofthresholds, hysteresis, and alternative stable states. We develop aconceptual framework for studying interactions between the dynamics ofmarshes and habitats in shallow coastal bays with unconsolidated sediments(seagrass, oyster reefs). Using examples primarily from the Virginia CoastReserve Long Term Ecological Research site, we show that in the subtidalpart of the landscape, two alternative stable states can exist-onedominated by seagrass up to a certain depth that represents a tippingpoint to the second, unvegetated stable state. The depth limit of theseagrass stable state is influenced by (1) the positive feedback ofvegetation on reducing sediment suspension and improving the lightenvironment for growth, (2) climate (e.g., temperature), and (3) waterquality. Two stable states are also present in intertidal areas, with saltmarshes lying above mean sea level and tidal flats below mean sea level.State transitions are driven by sediment availability, sea level rise, therelative strength of wind waves with respect to tidal currents, and thebiotic feedback of vegetation on sediment stabilization and accretion.State-change dynamics in one system may propagate to adjacent systems, andthis coupling may influence the landscape-scale response to environmentalchange. Seagrass meadows and oyster reefs affect adjacent marshes bothpositively (wave attenuation) and negatively (reduced sediment supply),and marsh-edge erosion could negatively influence the light environmentfor seagrass growth. Forecasting the resilience of coastal ecosystems andthe landscape-scale response to environmental change in the next centuryrequires an understanding of nonlinear dynamics, including the possibilityof multiple stable states, the coupled evolution of adjacent systems, andpotential early warning signs of thresholds of change. \textcopyright 2013by The Oceanography Society.

The main objective of this study was toquantify the amount of nitrate–N (NO3–N), ammonium–N (NH4–N), solublereactive P (SRP), and total dissolved iron (TDFe) released fromagricultural soils undergoing SWI to determine their potential loss todownstream waterways. Agricultural soils were incubated for 0, 15, and 30days (under oxic and anoxic conditions) with various salt solutioncombinations of sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), calciumsulfate (CaSO4), and Instant Ocean® to mimic (1) different ionicconstituents of saltwater at different ionic strengths and (2) thepresence or absence of gypsum, a soil amendment, through the addition ofCaSO4. We also included a set of incubations treated with deionized wateras a no ionic strength control (0.00 M). To increase statistical power, wegrouped individual salt treatments based on our initial hypotheses at theend of the incubation period (day 30) to determine the effects of high(0.26–0.28 M) and low (0.03–0.04 M) ionic strength on inorganic N releaseand combinations of Ca and SO42− additions on SRP release to microcosmsoil solution. Calcium additions decreased SRP release relative tosaltwater that contained only NaCl additions under oxic and anoxicconditions. Additionally, high ionic strength treatments, which were about7 times the ionic strength of low ionic strength treatments, released twotimes as much NH4–N to the soil solution, which suggests a non-linearrelationship between ionic strength and NH4–N release. At day 30, anoxicmicrocosm soils treated with Instant Ocean® to simulate 15 parts perthousand seawater (ionic strength 0.26 M) released significantly moreNH4–N (by 782 times), SRP (by 6 times), and TDFe (by 197 times) to thesoil solution than oxic microcosm soils (P < 0.05). This treatment wasdesigned to reflect a field inundated by brackish seawater for almost amonth, which is representative of conditions on farm fields undergoingSWI. Under these anoxic conditions, as much as 22% of bioavailable soil P(as SRP) and 45% of total inorganic N (as NH4–N) could be released tooverlying water when inundated with saltwater. Our work indicates that theinflux of salts and inundation of SWI-affected farm fields could lead to alarge export of N and P from agricultural soils and potentially affectdownstream water quality.",2021,,Biogeochemistry,154,3,451-469,,10.1007/s10533-021-00796-6,,#96,Weissman 2021,,

As communities, regulatory agencies, andpolicy-makers plan for rising seas, it is important to recognize thelandscapes of race and deep histories of racism that have shaped thesocio-ecological formations of coastal regions. If this history goesunrecognized, what we label colorblind adaptation planning is likely toperpetuate what Rob Nixon calls the “slow violence” of environmentalracism, characterized by policies that benefit some populations whileabandoning others. By colorblind adaptation planning, we refer tovulnerability mitigation and adaptation planning projects that altogetheroverlook racial inequality—or worse dismiss its systemic causes andexplain away racial inequality by attributing racial disparities tonon-racial causes. We contend that responses to sea-level rise must beattuned to racial difference and structures of racial inequality. In thisarticle, we combine the theory of racial formation with the geographicalstudy of environmental justice and point to the ways racial formations arealso environmental. We examine vulnerability to sea-level rise through theprocess of racial coastal formation on Sapelo Island, Georgia,specifically analyzing its deep history, the uneven racial development ofland ownership and employment, and barriers to African Americanparticipation and inclusion in adaptation planning.

All Rights Reserved. Coastal freshwaterwetland chemistry is rapidly changing due to increased frequency of saltwater incursion, a consequence of global change. Seasonal salt waterincursion introduces sulfate, which microbially reduces to sulfide.Sulfide binds with reduced iron, producing iron sulfide (FeS),recognizable in wetland soils by its characteristic black color. Theobjective of this study is to document iron and sulfate reduction rates,as well as product formation (acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromiumreducible sulfide (CRS)) in a coastal freshwater wetland undergoingseasonal salt water incursion. Understanding iron and sulfur cycling, aswell as their reduction products, allows us to calculate the degree ofsulfidization (DOS), from which we can estimate how long soil iron willbuffer against chemical effects of sea level rise. We show that soilchloride, a direct indicator of the degree of incursion, best predictediron and sulfate reduction rates. Correlations between soil chloride andiron or sulfur reduction rates were strongest in the surface layer (0-3cm), indicative of surface water incursion, rather than groundwaterintrusion at our site. The interaction between soil moisture andextractable chloride was significantly related to increased AVS, whereasincreased soil chloride was a stronger predictor of CRS. The current DOSin this coastal plains wetland is very low, resulting from high soil ironcontent and relatively small degree of salt water incursion. However, withtime and continuous salt water exposure, iron will bind with incomingsulfur, creating FeS complexes, and DOS will increase.",2014,,Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences,119,12,,,10.1002/2014JG002739,,#100,Schoepfer 2014,,

Though baldcypress are known to tolerate moderate floodingand salinity, their growth has been shown to decrease when they experiencedrought and high salinity. This study examined the effects of drought andelevated salinity on the growth of baldcypress seedlings and saplings. Ina restored wetland in North Carolina, we examined the growth of 8-year-oldbaldcypress by measuring height and diameter at breast height (DBH) alongsalinity, nutrient, and flooding gradients. In a greenhouse, we placed1-year-old baldcypress seedlings in either drought or saturated conditionsand applied different water treatments: fresh water, sulfate, andartificial salt water (5 ppt [parts per thousand]). Over 26 weeks, wemeasured diameter at root collar, height, and biomass. In the field,chloride concentrations in soil solution had a negative effect on DBH andheight (51 and 36% decrease, respectively); high water levels had anegative effect on height (47% decrease) and DBH (46% decrease). In thegreenhouse, both drought and salinity decreased diameter growth (43 and61% decline, respectively) and height (64 and 43% decline, respectively).Sulfate did not have a significant effect on diameter growth, but caused a14% decrease in height. Our results suggest that both drought and salinity(even as low as 1 ppt) can lead to a 20–60% decline in baldcypress growth.Restoration practitioners should consider the negative consequences ofboth drought and increased salinity on baldcypress growth when planningfor wetland restoration.",2016,,Restor.

Speciesthat nested on ocean beaches (Diamondback Terrapins, shorebirds, andterns) were also ranked highly, but their use of other foraging habitatsreduced their overall exposure. Future studies on potential effects of SLRon vertebrates in southeastern coastal ecosystems should focus on therelative importance of different habitat types to these species' foragingand nesting requirements.

46,Understanding Vulnerability of Coastal Communities to Climate ChangeRelated Risks,"Dolan, A H; Walker, I J","[This paper discusses the concept of vulnerability as characterized in theclimate change literature and presents a framework for assessing adaptivecapacity. The framework recognizes inherent susceptibilities ofhuman-environment systems exposed to climate variability and change. Asclimate change impacts are unevenly distributed among and within nations,regions, communities and individuals due to differential exposures andvulnerabilities, the framework highlights determinants of adaptivecapacity at the local scale and situates them within larger regional,national and international settings. Determinants include: access anddistribution of resources, technology, information and wealth; riskperceptions; social capital and community structure; and institutionalframeworks that address climate change hazards. This broader approachcontrasts typical impact assessments that focus largely on reducingeconomic detriments of change. The framework provides a methodologicalstarting point that, as a community-based or 'bottom-up' approach, yieldsimportant insight on local responses to climate change. It also recognizesthat short-term exposure to variability is an important source ofvulnerability superimposed on long-term change. At the community level,perceptions and experiences with climate extremes can identify inherentcharacteristics that enable or constrain a community to respond, recoverand adapt. As such, local and traditional knowledge is key to climatechange research and should be incorporated into research design andimplementation. This approach provides locally relevant outcomes thatcould promote more effective decision-making, planning and management inremote areas susceptible to climate change hazards. As part of a largerstudy, this approach will be refined with local input to study sea-levelrise impacts on one of Canada's most sensitive coastlines, northeastGraham Island, Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands), British Columbia.Preliminary evidence of changes and responses in this area are identifiedas a brief case study.]",2006,,J.

The syndrome is caused by salt pollution (e.g.,road deicers, irrigation runoff, sewage, potash), accelerated weatheringand soil cation exchange, mining and resource extraction, and the presenceof easily weathered minerals used in agriculture (lime) and urbanization(concrete). Increasing salts with strong bases and carbonates elevate acidneutralizing capacity and pH, and increasing sodium from salt pollutioneventually displaces base cations on soil exchange sites, which furtherincreases pH and alkalinization. Symptoms of the syndrome can include:infrastructure corrosion, contaminant mobilization, and variations incoastal ocean acidification caused by increasingly alkaline river inputs.Unless regulated and managed, the freshwater salinization syndrome canhave significant impacts on ecosystem services such as safe drinkingwater, contaminant retention, and biodiversity.",2018,,Proc.

Thispaper presents estimates of how future changes in relative sea-level riseputs coastal populations at risk, as well as affect overall GDP in theconterminous United States. We use four different sea-level rise scenariosfor 2010–2100: a low-end scenario (Extended Linear Trend) a second low-endscenario based on a strong mitigative global warming pathway (GlobalWarming Coupling 2.6), a high-end scenario based on rising radiativeforcing (Global Warming Coupling 8.5) and a plausible very high-endscenario, including accelerated ice cap melting (Global Warming Coupling8.5+). Relative sea-level rise trends for each US state are employed toobtain more reasonable rates for these areas, as long-term rates varyconsiderably between the US Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts because ofthe Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, local subsidence and sedimentcompaction, and other vertical land movement. Using these trends for thefour scenarios reveals that the relative sea levels predicted by century'send could range – averaged over all states – from 0.2 to 2.0m abovepresent levels. The estimates for the amount of land inundated vary from26,000 to 76,000km2. Upwards of 1.8 to 7.4 million people could be atrisk, and GDP could potentially decline by USD 70–289 billion.Unfortunately, there are many uncertainties associated with the impactestimates due to the limitations of the input data, especially the inputelevation data. Taking this into account, even the most conservativescenario shows a significant impact for the US, emphasizing the importanceof adaptation and mitigation.",2013,,Glob. Environ.

50,Rural coastal community resilience: Assessing a framework in eastern NorthCarolina,"Jurjonas, Matthew; Seekamp, Erin","Rural coastal communities have unique vulnerabilities to the impactscaused by sea level rise and saltwater intrusion compared to coastal urbanareas that have growing populations, increasing property values, andextensive infrastructure. In contrast, rural coastal communities aretypically dependent on traditional natural resource livelihoods likefarming, commercial fishing, forestry, and outdoor recreationopportunities. Saltwater intrusion, exacerbated by sea level rise, impactsrural livelihoods by limiting suitable agricultural land and developmentoptions, which compounds local economic difficulties. Higher rates ofpoverty, aging demographics, and out-migration already challenge theresilience of rural coastal communities. Informed by sociological researchthat addresses the local economic factors unique to rural communities andresilience research on coastal communities and natural hazards, we proposethe Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework. We test the RCCRframework through a series of focus groups within the Albemarle PamlicoPeninsula of North Carolina (U.S.), a low-lying, rural region with nearlyone-half of its land less than 1 m above sea level. Applying the RCCRframework revealed that local priorities include maintaining rurallivelihoods, creating job opportunities, and addressing highly vulnerablepopulations.

East Boston is predominantly a residential area with someindustrial and commercial activities, particularly along the coastalfringe. Everett, a city to the north of Boston, has a diversifiedindustrial and commercial base. While these two communities have similarsocioeconomic characteristics, they differ substantially in the extent towhich residents would be impacted by increased coastal flooding. In EastBoston, a large portion of residents would be flooded, while in Everett,it is the commercial/industrial districts that are primarily vulnerable.Through a series of workshops with residents in each community, we foundthat the target populations do not have an adaptation perspective orknowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge.Furthermore, they do not feel included in the planning processes withintheir communities. However, a common incentive for both communities was anintense commitment to their communities and an eagerness to learn more andbecome actively engaged in decisions regarding climate change adaptation.The lessons that can be applied to other studies include 1) images arepowerful tools in communicating concepts, 2) understanding existingcultural knowledge and values in adaptation planning is essential to theplanning process and 3) engaging local residents at the beginning of theprocess can create important educational opportunities and develop trustand consensus that is necessary for moving from concept to implementation.",2012,,Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,,,,,10.1007/s11027-011-9340-8,,#137,Douglas 2012,,

55,Coastal Wetland Distributions: Delineating Domains of Macroscale Driversand Local Feedbacks,"Braswell, Anna E; Heffernan, James B","How do multiple stable states influence local and macroscale ecologicalpatterns? Understanding how local feedbacks operate within heterogeneouscoastal environments is essential to forecasting marsh persistence andloss in response to sea level rise, river impoundment, and otherenvironmental changes. In coastal lagoons, feedbacks between open water,wind erosion, and stabilizing effects from wetland vegetation produce twostates: open water with fringing marshes, and marsh-dominated basins.Unknown is whether, how, and at what scales these feedbacks affectdistribution of marsh ecosystems in large, complex estuaries, wheremacroscale coastal and watershed characteristics control suspendedsediment and wind energy. Using a multi-scale geospatial analysis spanningthe Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the USA, we show that characteristics ofestuaries (depth, shoreline complexity, land use, tidal range, latitude)and their watersheds (discharge) best predict wetland extent at broadspatial scales (~> 102 km2). Bimodal distribution of wetland extent occursat finer scales (~ 100 to 102 km2) that correspond to the theoreticalscale of wave erosion feedbacks. Local feedbacks are thus the mechanismthat controls marsh dynamics, whereas coastal and watershedcharacteristics determine macroscale wetland distributions through theireffects on these processes. In coastal marshes, and likely in othercomplex landscapes, the spatial extent of feedbacks shapes the scales atwhich local and macroscale processes control the distribution ofalternative stable states. These findings help predict scales at whichcoastal wetlands will respond catastrophically or continuously toenvironmental change, and provide a basis for multi-scale strategies toprotect and restore coastal wetland ecosystems.",2019,,Ecosystems,,,,,10.1007/s10021-018-0332-3,,#146,Braswell 2019,,

The causes of salinization arediverse and include alterations to freshwater flows, land-clearance,irrigation, disposal of wastewater effluent, sea level rise, storm surges,and applications of de-icing salts. Climate change and anthropogenicmodifications to the hydrologic cycle are expected to further increase theextent and severity of wetland salinization. Salinization alters thefundamental physicochemical nature of the soil-water environment,increasing ionic concentrations and altering chemical equilibria andmineral solubility. Increased concentrations of solutes, especiallysulfate, alter the biogeochemical cycling of major elements includingcarbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, and silica. The effects ofsalinization on wetland biogeochemistry typically include decreasedinorganic nitrogen removal (with implications for water quality andclimate regulation), decreased carbon storage (with implications forclimate regulation and wetland accretion), and increased generation oftoxic sulfides (with implications for nutrient cycling and thehealth/functioning of wetland biota). Indeed, increased salt and sulfideconcentrations induce physiological stress in wetland biota and ultimatelycan result in large shifts in wetland communities and their associatedecosystem functions. The productivity and composition of freshwaterspecies assemblages will be highly altered, and there is a high potentialfor the disruption of existing interspecific interactions. Although thereis a wealth of information on how salinization impacts individualecosystem components, relatively few studies have addressed the complexand often non-linear feedbacks that determine ecosystem-scale responses orconsidered how wetland salinization will affect landscape-level processes.Although the salinization of wetlands may be unavoidable in many cases,these systems may also prove to be a fertile testing ground for broaderecological theories including (but not limited to): investigations intoalternative stable states and tipping points, trophic cascades,disturbance-recovery processes, and the role of historical events andlandscape context in driving community response to disturbance.",2015,,Ecosphere,6,10,art206,,10.1890/ES14-00534.1,,#147,Herbert 2015,,

We quantified soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)mineralization using seasonal in situ incubations of modified resin coresalong spatial gradients of chronic salinification (from continuouslyfreshwater tidal forest to salt impacted tidal forest to oligohalinemarsh) and in hummocks and hollows of the continuously freshwater tidalforest along the blackwater Waccamaw River and alluvial Savannah River.Salinification increased rates of net N and P mineralization fluxes andturnover in tidal freshwater forested wetland soils, most likely throughtree stress and senescence (for N) and conversion to oligohaline marsh(for P). Stimulation of N and P mineralization by chronic salinificationwas apparently unrelated to inputs of sulfate (for N and P) or directeffects of increased soil conductivity (for N). In addition, the tidalwetland soils of the alluvial river mineralized more P relative to N thanthe blackwater river. Finally, hummocks had much greater nitrificationfluxes than hollows at the continuously freshwater tidal forested wetlandsites.

Little is known, however, about howspatial variation in these factors exactly relates to human settlementsand activities, and how this has developed over time. Such knowledge isimportant for identifying vulnerable regions that are at risk fromphenomena such as food shortages and water stress. Human activities are akey driving force in global change, and thus detailed information onpopulation distribution is an important input to any research framework onglobal change. In this paper we assess the global geospatial patterns ofthe distribution of human population and related factors, with regard tothe altitude above sea level and proximity to the coast. The investigatedfactors are physical conditions, urbanisation, agricultural practices,economy, and environmental stress. An important novel element in thisstudy, is that we included the temporal evolution in various factorsrelated to human settlements and agricultural practices over the 20thcentury, and used projections for some of these factors up to the year2050. We found population pressure in the proximity of the coast to besomewhat greater than was found in other studies. Yet, the distribution ofpopulation, urbanisation and wealth are evolving to become more evenlyspread across the globe than they were in the past. Therefore, thecommonly believed tendency of accumulation of people and wealth alongcoasts is not supported by our results. At the same time, food productionis becoming increasingly decoupled from the trends in population density.Croplands are spreading from highly populated coastal zones towards inlandzones. Our results thus indicate that even though people and wealthcontinue to accumulate in proximity to the coast, population densities andeconomic productivity are becoming less diverse in relation to elevationand distance from the coast.",2016,,Environ.

For any delta, ESLR is a netrate, defined by the combination of eustatic sea-level rise, the naturalgross rate of fluvial sediment deposition and subsidence, and acceleratedsubsidence due to groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction. ESLR isestimated under present conditions using a digital data set of deltaboundaries and a simple model of delta dynamics. The deltas in this studyrepresent all major climate zones, levels of population density, anddegrees of economic development. Collectively, the sampled deltas serve asthe endpoint for river basins draining 30% of the Earth's landmass, and42% of global terrestrial runoff. Nearly 300 million people inhabit thesedeltas. For the contemporary baseline, ESLR estimates range from 0.5 to12.5 mm yr - 1 . Decreased accretion of fluvial sediment resulting fromupstream siltation of artificial impoundments and consumptive losses ofrunoff from irrigation are the primary determinants of ESLR in nearly 70%of the deltas. Approximately 20% of the deltas show acceleratedsubsidence, while only 12% show eustatic sea-level rise as the predominanteffect. Extrapolating contemporary rates of ESLR through 2050 reveals that8.7 million people and 28,000 km 2 of deltaic area in the sample set ofdeltas could suffer from enhanced inundation and increased coastalerosion. The population and area inundated rise significantly whenconsidering increased flood risk due to storm surge. This study finds thatdirect anthropogenic effects determine ESLR in the majority of deltasstudied, with a relatively less important role for eustatic sea-levelrise.

The fraction of dissolved NH(4) (+)relative to adsorbed NH(4) (+) in oligohaline sediments rose significantlywith increased pore water salinity over the season. Laboratory experimentsdemonstrated that small (similar to 3) increases in salinity fromfreshwater conditions had the greatest effect on NH(4) (+) adsorption byreducing the exchangeable pool from 69% to 14% of the total NH(4) (+) inthe upper estuary sediments that experience large (0-20) seasonal salinityshifts. NH(4) (+) dynamics did not appear to be significantly affected bysalinity in sediments of the lower estuary where salinities under 10 werenot measured. We further assessed the importance of salinity-mediateddesorption by constructing a simple mechanistic numerical model for porewater chloride and NH(4) (+) diffusion for sediments of the upper estuary.The model predicted pore water salinity and NH(4) (+) profiles that fitmeasured profiles very well and described a seasonal pattern of NH(4) (+)flux from the sediment that was significantly affected by salinity. Themodel demonstrated that changes in salinity on several timescales(tidally, seasonally, and annually) can significantly alter the magnitudeand timing of NH(4) (+) release from the sediments. Salinity-mediateddesorption and fluxes of NH(4) (+) from sediments in the upper estuary canbe of similar magnitude to rates of organic nitrogen mineralization andmay therefore be important in supporting estuarine productivity whenwatershed inputs of N are low.",2010,,Estuaries Coasts,33,4,985-1003,,10.1007/s12237-010-9282-5,,#171,Weston 2010,,

Ideally, to be useful in long-term sea levelstudies, vertical land motion should be determined with standard errorsthat are 1 order of magnitude lower than the contemporary climate signalsof 1 to 3?mm/yr observed on average in sea level records, either usingtide gauges or satellites. This metrological requirement constitutes achallenge in geodesy. Here we review the most successful instrumentalmethods that have been used to determine vertical displacements at theEarth's surface, so that the objectives of understanding and anticipatingsea levels can be addressed adequately in terms of accuracy. In thisrespect, the required level of uncertainty is examined in two case studies(global and local). A special focus is given to the use of the GlobalPositioning System (GPS) and to the combination of satellite radaraltimetry with tide gauge data.

76,Exploring the impacts of flood insurance reform on vulnerable communities,"Nance, Earthea","This paper identifies geographic areas whose real estate markets werepotentially impacted by US flood insurance reform, and it exploresconcurrent vulnerabilities—by income and race—in the most impacted areas.Because of the geographic and demographic significance of the Gulf Coastin terms of flood risk, flood insurance, and vulnerability, theHouston-Galveston region was selected for analysis. Flood insurance reformunder the Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 occurredunabated over a 21-month period from July 2012 to March 2014. This periodrepresents a unique real-world intervention that can be analyzed using aquasi-experimental design. The period was characterized by numerousanecdotal reports of spiking flood insurance rates and market uncertainty.Market data were gathered for two years before and two years afterBiggert–Waters in Harris and Galveston Counties. Paired z-tests wereperformed to examine before and after market differences. Findings showed17 zip codes that experienced significant impacts (p\textless0.01 in 14zip codes, p\textless0.05 in 3 zip codes). Among the significantlyimpacted zip codes, low-income households were overrepresented by 11% inHarris County and by 32% in Galveston County; and minorities wereoverrepresented by 43% in Galveston. These results support the hypothesisthat flood insurance reform can have disproportionate impacts. The paperprovides a straightforward approach for analyzing the real estate marketimpacts of flood insurance reform at a community scale. It also provides abasis for recommending that regulatory decisions involving flood insurancemust be informed by an analysis of disproportionate impacts.",2015,,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,13,,20-36,,10.1016/J.IJDRR.2015.03.001,,#204,Nance 2015,,

78,Direct and indirect controls on organic matter decomposition in fourcoastal wetland communities along a landscape salinity gradient,"Stagg, Camille L; Baustian, Melissa M; Perry, Carey L; Carruthers, Tim J B; Hall, Courtney T","Coastal wetlands store more carbon than most ecosystems globally. As sealevel rises, changes in flooding and salinity will potentially impactecological functions, such as organic matter decomposition, that influencecarbon storage. However, little is known about the mechanisms that controlorganic matter loss in coastal wetlands at the landscape scale. As sealevel rises, how will the shift from fresh to salt-tolerant plantcommunities impact organic matter decomposition? Do long-term,plant-mediated, effects of sea-level rise differ from direct effects ofelevated salinity and flooding? We identified internal and externalfactors that regulated indirect and direct pathways of sea-level riseimpacts, respectively, along a landscape-scale salinity gradient thatincorporated changes in wetland type (fresh, oligohaline, mesohaline andpolyhaline marshes). We found that indirect and direct impacts ofsea-level rise had opposing effects on organic matter decomposition.Salinity had an indirect effect on litter decomposition that was mediatedthrough litter quality. Despite significant variation in environmentalconditions along the landscape gradient, the best predictors of above- andbelow-ground litter decomposition were internal drivers, initial litternitrogen content and initial litter lignin content respectively. Litterdecay constants were greatest in the oligohaline marsh and declined withincreasing salinity, and the fraction of litter remaining (asymptote) wasgreatest in the mesohaline marsh. In contrast, direct effects of salinityand flooding were positive. External drivers, salinity and flooding,stimulated cellulytic activity, which was highest in the polyhaline marsh.Synthesis. Our results indicate that as sea level rises, initial directeffects of salinity will stimulate decay of labile carbon, but over timeas plant communities shift from fresh to polyhaline marsh, litter decaywill decline, yielding greater potential for long-term carbon storage.These findings highlight the importance of quantifying carbon loss atmultiple temporal scales, not only in coastal wetlands but also in otherecosystems where plant-mediated responses to climate change will havesignificant impacts on carbon cycling.",2018,,J.

Coastal peatlands areglobally important carbon sinks that are vulnerable to carbon loss withsaltwater intrusion. It is uncertain how wetland carbon stocks and fluxeschange during freshwater restoration following exposure to saltwater andelevated nutrients. We restored freshwater to sawgrass (Cladiumjamaicense) peat monoliths from freshwater marshes of the Everglades(Florida, U.S.A.) that had previously been exposed to elevated salinity(approximately9 ppt) and phosphorus (P) loading (1 g P m?2 year?1) inwetland mesocosms. We quantified changes in water and soilphysicochemistry, plant and soil carbon and nutrient standing stocks, andnet ecosystem productivity during restoration. Added freshwaterimmediately reduced porewater salinity from >8 to approximately 2 ppt, butelevated porewater dissolved organic carbon persisted. Above- andbelowground biomass, leaf P concentrations, and instantaneous rates ofgross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) remainedelevated from prior added P. Modeled monthly GEP and ER were higher inmarshes with saltwater and P legacies, resulting in negative net ecosystemproductivities that were up to 12? lower than controls. Leaf litterbreakdown rates and litter P concentrations were 2? higher in marshes withlegacies of added saltwater and P. Legacies of saltwater and P on carbonloss persisted despite freshwater restoration, but recovery was greatestfor freshwater marshes exposed to saltwater alone.

81,Potential biochemical indicators of salinity tolerance in plants,"Ashraf, M; Harris, P J C","Despite a wealth of published research on salinity tolerance of plants,neither the metabolic sites at which salt stress damages plants nor theadaptive mechanisms utilized by plants to survive under saline conditionsare well understood. As a result, there are no well-defined indicators forsalinity tolerance available to assist plant breeders in the improvementof salinity tolerance of important agricultural crops. Although plantbreeders have successfully improved salinity tolerance of some crops inrecent decades, using plant vigor or seed yield as the main selectioncriteria, selection may be more convenient and practicable if the croppossesses distinctive indicators of salt tolerance at the whole plant,tissue or cellular level. Thus, there is a need to determine theunderlying biochemical mechanisms of salinity tolerance so as to provideplant breeders with appropriate indicators. In this review, thepossibility of using these biochemical characteristics as selectioncriteria for salt tolerance is discussed. It is concluded that althoughthere are a number of promising selection criteria, the complex physiologyof salt tolerance and the variation between species make it difficult toidentify single criteria. Progress is more likely if biochemicalindicators for individual species rather than generic indicators can bedetermined. \textcopyright 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As opposed tonostalgia--the melancholia or homesickness experienced by individuals whenseparated from a loved home--solastalgia is the distress that is producedby environmental change impacting on people while they are directlyconnected to their home environment. The paper will focus on two contextswhere collaborative research teams have found solastalgia to be evident:the experiences of persistent drought in rural NSW and the impact oflarge-scale open-cut coal mining on individuals in the Upper Hunter Valleyof NSW. In both cases, people exposed to environmental change experiencednegative affect that is exacerbated by a sense of powerlessness or lack ofcontrol over the unfolding change process. METHODS: Qualitative(interviews and focus groups) and quantitative (community-based surveys)research has been conducted on the lived experience of drought and mining,and the findings relevant to solastalgia are presented. RESULTS: Theauthors are exploring the potential uses and applications of the conceptof solastalgia for understanding the psychological impact of theincreasing incidence of environmental change worldwide. CONCLUSIONS:Worldwide, there is an increase in ecosystem distress syndromes matched bya corresponding increase in human distress syndromes.

Although recent research has investigated thedrivers and rates of coastal forest decline, the associated changes incarbon storage across large extents have not been quantified. We mappedghost forest spread across coastal North Carolina, USA, using repeat LightDetection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys, multi-temporal satellite imagery,and field measurements of aboveground biomass to quantify changes inaboveground carbon. Between 2001 and 2014, 15% (167 km2) of unmanagedpublic land in the region changed from coastal forest to transition-ghostforest characterized by salt-tolerant shrubs and herbaceous plants.Salinity and proximity to the estuarine shoreline were significant driversof these changes. This conversion resulted in a net aboveground carbondecline of 0.13 ± 0.01 TgC. Because saltwater intrusion precedesinundation and influences vegetation condition in advance of mature treemortality, we suggest that aboveground carbon declines can be used todetect the leading edge of sea level rise. Aboveground carbon declinesalong the shoreline were offset by inland aboveground carbon gainsassociated with natural succession and forestry activities like planting(2.46 ± 0.25 TgC net aboveground carbon across study area). Our studyhighlights the combined effects of saltwater intrusion and land use onaboveground carbon dynamics of temperate coastal forests in North America.By quantifying the effects of multiple interacting disturbances, ourmeasurement and mapping methods should be applicable to other coastallandscapes experiencing saltwater intrusion. As sea level rise increasesthe landward extent of inundation and saltwater exposure, investigationsat these large scales are requisite for effective resource allocation forclimate adaptation.

Global-scale projections suggest that between20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios,respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, whichwill in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valuedecosystem services1-3. These projections do not necessarily take intoaccount all essential geomorphological4-7 and socio-economic systemfeedbacks8. Here we present an integrated global modelling approach thatconsiders both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically bysediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical andlateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonizedby wetland vegetation. We use this approach to assess global-scale changesin coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise andanthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century. On thebasis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses,wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, ifmore than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space)of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sedimentsupply remains at present levels. In contrast to previous studies1-3, weproject that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area willrange between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation spacein addition to current levels. Our simulations suggest that the resilienceof global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability ofaccommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building ofanthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructureis expected to change over the twenty-first century. Rather than being aninevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicatethat large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, ifsufficient additional accommodation space can be created through carefulnature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management.",2018,,Nature,561,7722,231-234,,10.1038/s41586-018-0476-5,,#228,Schuerch 2018,,

The objective of this study was todetermine how saltwater intrusion affects wetland nutrientbiogeochemistry, with a specific focus on the soil microbial communitiesand physicochemical parameters that control nitrate removal. Our work tookplace in a tidal freshwater marsh in South Carolina, USA, where a 3.5-yearsaltwater intrusion experiment increased porewater salinities fromfreshwater to oligohaline levels. We measured rates of denitrification,soil oxygen demand, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)and used molecular genetic techniques to assess the abundance andcommunity structure of soil microbes. In soils exposed to elevatedsalinities, rates of denitrification were reduced by about 70% due tochanges in the soil physicochemical environment (higher salinity, highercarbon:nitrogen ratio) and shifts in the community composition ofdenitrifiers. Saltwater intrusion also affected the microbial communityresponsible for DNRA, increasing the abundance of genes associated withthis process and shifting microbial community composition. Though rates ofDNRA were below detection, the microbial community response may be aprecursor to increased rates of DNRA with continued saltwater intrusion.Overall, saltwater intrusion reduces the ability of tidal freshwatermarshes to convert reactive nitrogen to dinitrogen gas and thereforenegatively affects their water quality functions. Continued study of theinterrelationships between biotic communities, the abiotic environment,and biogeochemical transformations will lead to a better understanding ofhow the progressive replacement of tidal freshwater marshes with brackishanalogues will affect the overall functioning of the coastal landscape.",2019,,Ecosystems,22,4,912-928,,10.1007/s10021-018-0312-7,,#235,Neubauer 2019,,

The phosphorus sorption dynamics of two limestone rocks ofdifferent composition were investigated by simulating seawater intrusionover a wide range of mixing ratios between freshwater and saltwater. Bothrocks exhibited a logarithmic loss of sorption efficiency in mixturescontaining more than approximately 3 mM Cl− concentration (100 mg Cl−/L;about <1% saltwater). We infer that aquifer solids immersed in freshwaterwould undergo phosphorus desorption in response to the introduction ofthis minor amount of seawater. This Cl− concentration is within the rangedesignated as fresh water. Thus we conclude that increased solublereactive phosphorus availability from saltwater-induced desorption mayoccur at the ion exchange front, which is actually landward of thesaltwater intrusion front as it is commonly defined. Sorption efficiencyin our experiments continued to decline as salinity increased, until Cl−concentration reached a second threshold of 50 or 200 mM (1700 or 7700 mgCl−/L), depending on the rock composition, particularly iron content.Further increase in salinity would produce little increase in groundwatersoluble reactive phosphorus concentration.

93,Identifying Sources and Oxidation of Methane in Standing Dead Trees inFreshwater Forested Wetlands,"Martinez, Melinda; Ardón, Marcelo; Carmichael, Mary Jane","Wetlands are large sources of methane (CH4), therefore it is vital tounderstand the pathways, mechanisms, and sources to anticipate futurepositive feedbacks to climate change. Plant mediated transport of CH4 fromsediment-borne gases is thought to be a major contributor in wetlandecosystems, though few studies have measured standing dead trees (snags).Snags are expected to become more common across the southeastern coast asmarshes migrate into freshwater forested wetlands. In this study, our goalwas to distinguish the main sources of CH4 being emitted from snags, thatis, from soil or in situ origin. The δ2H and δ13C stable isotopiccomposition from various sources was sampled for source determination. Wemeasured CH4 in various components: emissions from snag stem sides and thesoil-atmosphere interface; and concentrations from snag trunk airspace atvarious heights from ground level (30, 60, and 120 cm), and soilporewater. Potential CH4 production and oxidation in tree cores from twoheights (60 and 120 cm) was also measured to examine the potential for CH4generation or oxidation in stems. We found that CH4 concentrations insidesnags (∼10–200 ppm) were 2–50 times higher than atmospheric levels, andgenerally decreased with increasing stem height. The stable isotopes δ13Cand δ2H showed an enrichment from porewater to soils and snag stems. δ13Cenrichment of CH4 in snag stems suggests that CH4 is being oxidized as itmoves through snags. The tree core vial incubations showed that very fewcores produced small amounts of CH4 under anaerobic conditions (n = 5 outof 50), and very few cores oxidized CH4 under more aerobic conditions (n =5 out of 50). It is possible that a small amount of CH4 is producedin-situ within the heartwood, but it is likely this depends on thedensity, porosity, and aeration of snags (degree of decay). Our resultshighlight that high concentrations of CH4 can persist within the heartwoodof snags long after initial decay, and that CH4 emitted from snags islargely derived from deep wetland soils and oxidized during transport (viadiffusion) throughout the stem of snags.",2022,,Front.

95,Applications of network analysis for adaptive management of artificialdrainage systems in landscapes vulnerable to sea level rise,"Poulter, Benjamin; Goodall, Jonathan L; Halpin, Patrick N","Summary The vulnerability of coastal landscapes to sea level rise iscompounded by the existence of extensive artificial drainage networksinitially built to lower water tables for agriculture, forestry, and humansettlements. These drainage networks are found in landscapes with littletopographic relief where channel flow is characterized by bi-directionalmovement across multiple time-scales and related to precipitation, wind,and tidal patterns. The current configuration of many artificial drainagenetworks exacerbates impacts associated with sea level rise such assalt-intrusion and increased flooding. This suggests that in theshort-term, drainage networks might be managed to mitigate sea level riserelated impacts. The challenge, however, is that hydrologic processes inregions where channel flow direction is weakly related to slope andtopography require extensive parameterization for numerical models whichis limited where network size is on the order of a hundred or morekilometers in total length. Here we present an application of graphtheoretic algorithms to efficiently investigate network propertiesrelevant to the management of a large artificial drainage system incoastal North Carolina, USA. We created a digital network modelrepresenting the observation network topology and four types of drainagefeatures (canal, collector and field ditches, and streams). We appliedbetweenness-centrality concepts (using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm)to determine major hydrologic flowpaths based off of hydraulic resistance.Following this, we identified sub-networks that could be managedindependently using a community structure and modularity approach. Lastly,a betweenness-centrality algorithm was applied to identify major shorelineentry points to the network that disproportionately control water movementin and out of the network. We demonstrate that graph theory can be appliedto solving management and monitoring problems associated with sea levelrise for poorly understood drainage networks in advance of numericalmethods.",2008,,J.

Humanappropriation of surface water and extensive ditching and draining ofcoastal plain landscapes are interacting with rising sea levels toincrease the frequency and magnitude of saltwater incursion into formerlyfreshwater coastal wetlands. Both hydrologic change and saltwaterincursion are expected to alter carbon and nutrient cycling in coastalforested wetlands. We performed a full factorial experiment in which weexposed intact soil cores from a coastal forested wetland to experimentalmarine salt treatments and two hydrologic treatments. We measured theresulting treatment effects on the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) over 112 days. Salinity effectswere compared across four treatments to isolate the effects of increasesin ionic strength from the impact of adding a terminal electron acceptor(SO42−). We compared control treatments (DI addition), to artificialsaltwater (ASW, target salinity of 5 parts per thousand) and to twotreatments that added sulfate alone (SO42−, at the concentration found in5 ppt saltwater) and saltwater with the sulfate removed (ASW-SO42−, withthe 5 ppt target salinity maintained by adding additional NaCl). We foundthat all salt treatments suppressed CO2 production, in both drought andflooded treatments. Contrary to our expectations, CH4 fluxes from ourflooded cores increased between 300 and 1200% relative to controls in theASW and ASW-SO42− treatments respectively. In the drought treatments, wesaw virtually no CH4 release from any core, while artificial seawater withsulfate increased N2O fluxes by 160% above DI control. In contrast, saltand sulfate decreased N2O fluxes by 72% in our flooded treatments. Ourresults indicate that salinization of forested wetlands of the coastalplain may have important climate feedbacks resulting from enhancedgreenhouse gas emissions and that the magnitude and direction of theseemissions are contingent upon wetland hydrology.",2018,,Biogeochemistry,140,2,217-232,,10.1007/s10533-018-0486-2,,#246,Ardón 2018,,

100,The impact of sea-level rise on saltwater intrusion for barrier-island aquifers in North Carolina,"Fiori, N.; Anderson Jr, W.P.","Saltwater intrusion is an increasing problem for coastal aquifers due to rising sea levels, especially in areas of low hydraulic gradient, such as barrier-island aquifer systems. Large-scale studies are particularly useful for identifying trends in the effects of sea-level rise, especially for relatively understudied barrier-island aquifers. The barrier islands of coastal North Carolina, U.S.A., lie in a hot spot of sea level rise, where rates are projected to exceed global means throughout this century. Herein, we present a study of the effects of sea-level rise using four primary study sites, each with varying hydraulic properties, island width, and rates of sea-level rise. We use these sites to understand the viability of barrier-island aquifers in North Carolina, but also to understand in general the factors that are most important to the future viability of all barrier-island aquifers. We utilize a one-dimensional steady-state analytical model that allows the calculation of the position of the toe of the saltwater wedge at the base of the aquifer while limiting a rise in the water table. We determine the position of the toe for various sea-level projections up to the year 2100 and utilize this parameter as an assessment of the viability of the aquifer. Our findings suggest that higher island width and lower hydraulic conductivity are the most sensitive parameters and help to limit the effects of sea-level rise on aquifer viability. Aquifer risk maps calculated for the entire North Carolina coast, which equate risk with the position of the toe relative to island width, demonstrate that sea-level rise is projected to have increasing impact on aquifer viability over time, but that areas with narrower width and higher sea-level rise rates are the most vulnerable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Cont.

101,Year-around survey and manipulation experiments reveal differential sensitivities of soil prokaryotic and fungal communities to saltwater intrusion in Florida Everglades wetlands,"Zhao, J.; Chakrabarti, S.; Chambers, R.; Weisenhorn, P.; Travieso, R.; Stumpf, S.; Standen, E.; Briceno, H.; Troxler, T.; Gaiser, E.; Kominoski, J.; Dhillon, B.; Martens-Habbena, W.","Global sea-level rise is transforming coastal ecosystems, especially freshwater wetlands, in part due to increased episodic or chronic saltwater exposure, leading to shifts in biogeochemistry, plant- and microbial communities, as well as ecological services. Yet, it is still difficult to predict how soil microbial communities respond to the saltwater exposure because of poorly understood microbial sensitivity within complex wetland soil microbial communities, as well as the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of wetland soils and saltwater exposure. To address this, we first conducted a two-year survey of microbial community structure and bottom water chemistry in submerged surface soils from 14 wetland sites across the Florida Everglades. We identified ecosystem-specific microbial biomarker taxa primarily associated with variation in salinity. Bacterial, archaeal and fungal community composition differed between freshwater, mangrove, and marine seagrass meadow sites, irrespective of soil type or season. Especially, methanogens, putative denitrifying methanotrophs and sulfate reducers shifted in relative abundance and/or composition between wetland types. Methanogens and putative denitrifying methanotrophs declined in relative abundance from freshwater to marine wetlands, whereas sulfate reducers showed the opposite trend. A four-year experimental simulation of saltwater intrusion in a pristine freshwater site and a previously saltwater-impacted site corroborated the highest sensitivity and relative increase of sulfate reducers, as well as taxon-specific sensitivity of methanogens, in response to continuously pulsing of saltwater treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that besides increased salinity, saltwater-mediated increased sulfate availability leads to displacement of methanogens by sulfate reducers even at low or temporal salt exposure. These changes of microbial composition could affect organic matter degradation pathways in coastal freshwater wetlands exposed to sea-level rise, with potential consequences, such as loss of stored soil organic carbon. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2023,,Sci.

Future climate change, especially intensified sea level rise (SLR), is expected to trigger SWI to encroach on coastal freshwater aquifers more intensively. Numerous studies have investigated decadal/century scale SWI under SLR by assuming a static coastal landscape topography. However, coastal landscapes are highly dynamic in response to SLR, and the impact of coastal landscape evolution on SWI has received very little attention. Thus, this study used a coastal marsh landscape as an example and investigated how coastal marsh evolution affects future SWI with a physically-based coastal hydro-eco-geomorphologic model, Advanced Terrestrial Simulator. Our numerical experiments showed that it is very likely that the marsh elevation increases with future SLR due to sediment deposition, and a depression zone is formed due to different marsh accretion rates between the ocean boundary and the inland. We found that marsh accretion may significantly reduce the surface saltwater inflow at the ocean boundary, and the evolved topographic depression zone may prolong the residence time of surface ponded saltwater, affecting subsurface salinity distribution differently. We also predicted that marshlands may become more sensitive to upland freshwater supply under future SLR, compared with previous predictions without marsh evolution. This study demonstrates the importance of coastal evolution to coastal freshwater-saltwater interaction. The eco-geomorphologic effect may not be ignored when evaluating coastal SWI under SLR at decadal or century scales. © 2022 The Authors.",2022,,Water Resour.

103,A phenology- and trend-based approach for accurate mapping of sea-level driven coastal forest retreat,"Chen, Y.; Kirwan, M.L.","The rapid replacement of upland forest by encroaching marshland is a striking manifestation of global sea-level rise (SLR). Timely and high-resolution information on the location and extent of transition forest (the ecotone between upland forest and marsh where tree mortality due to seawater intrusion begins) is fundamental to understanding the processes and patterns of SLR-driven landscape reorganization. Despite its significance, accurate characterization of salt-impacted transition forest remains challenging due to the complexity of coastal environments, scarcity of ground-truth data, and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. Here we use the full archive of Landsat images between 1984 and 2021 to investigate the spectral, temporal, and phenological characteristics of transition forest, and develop a robust framework for monitoring coastal vegetation shifts in the mid-Atlantic U.S., a global SLR hotspot. We found that transition forest exhibits strong negative NDVI trends and a deviation of land surface phenology from marsh and upland forest that distinguishes itself from surrounding vegetation. By integrating temporal trends and land surface phenology, our results demonstrate superior discrimination between marsh and coastal forests to existing map products (e.g. NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, National Land Cover Database) that allows a reliable identification of the coastal treeline. We applied the approach to map regional land cover in 1985, 2000 and 2020 (overall classification accuracy >92%) and found that the area of coastal forest decreased by 22.0% from 1985 to 2020, the majority of which transitioned to marshland (92.3%, 5.3 × 103 ha). Based upon fine-scale patterns of coastal transgression, we created a practical workflow for spatially explicit quantification of forest retreat rates. Concurrent with rising sea level, coastal forests migrated upslope from 0.63 (± 0.27) m above sea level in 1985 to 0.78 (± 0.32) m above sea level in 2020, and horizontal forest retreat rates accelerated from 3.1 (range of 0–36) m yr−1 during 1985–2000 to 4.7 (0–55) m yr−1 during 2001–2020. As SLR continues to accelerate, our study may serve as a scalable solution for consistent tracking of coastal landscape evolution that is urgently needed for sustainable forest and wetland management. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022,,Remote Sens.

104,Modeling impacts of drought-induced salinity intrusion on carbon dynamics in tidal freshwater forested wetlands,"Wang, H.; Dai, Z.; Trettin, C.C.; Krauss, K.W.; Noe, G.B.; Burton, A.J.; Stagg, C.L.; Ward, E.J.","Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide critical ecosystem services including an essential habitat for a variety of wildlife species and significant carbon sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, large uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of climate change on the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes and storage across a range of TFFW. In this study, we developed a process-driven Tidal Freshwater Wetlands DeNitrification-DeComposition model (TFW-DNDC) that has integrated new features, such as soil salinity effects on plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition to explore carbon dynamics in the TFFW in response to drought-induced saltwater intrusion. Eight sites along the floodplains of the Waccamaw River (USA) and the Savannah River (USA) were selected to represent the TFFW transition from healthy to moderately and highly salt-impacted forests, and eventually to oligohaline marshes. The TFW-DNDC was calibrated and validated using field observed annual litterfall, stem growth, root growth, soil heterotrophic respiration, and soil organic carbon storage. Analyses indicate that plant productivity and soil carbon sequestration in TFFW could change substantially in response to increased soil pore water salinity and reduced soil water table due to drought, but in interactive ways dependent on the river simulated. These responses are variable due to nonlinear relationships between carbon cycling processes and environmental drivers. Plant productivity, plant respiration, soil organic carbon sequestration rate, and storage in the highly salt-impacted forest sites decreased significantly under drought conditions compared with normal conditions. Considering the high likelihood of healthy and moderately salt-impacted forests becoming highly salt-impacted forests under future climate change and sea-level rise, it is very likely that the TFFW will lose their capacity as carbon sinks without up-slope migration. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.

We tested how elevated salinity and phosphorus (P) individually and interactively affect microbial activities and biogeochemical cycling in freshwater and brackish wetland soils. In experimental mesocosms, we added crossed gradients of elevated concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP) (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 μg/L) and salinity (0, 4, 7, 12, 16 ppt) to freshwater and brackish peat soils (10, 14, 17, 22, 26 ppt) for 35 d. We quantified changes in water chemistry [dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonium ((Formula presented.)), nitrate + nitrite (N + N), SRP concentrations], soil microbial extracellular enzyme activities, respiration rates, microbial biomass C, and soil chemistry (%C, %N, %P, C:N, C:P, N:P). DOC, (Formula presented.), and SRP increased in freshwater but decreased in brackish mesocosms with elevated salinity. DOC similarly decreased in brackish mesocosms with added P, and N + N decreased with elevated salinity in both freshwater and brackish mesocosms. In freshwater soils, water column P uptake occurred only in the absence of elevated salinity and when P was above 40 µg/L. Freshwater microbial EEAs, respiration rates, and microbial biomass C were consistently higher compared to those from brackish soils, and soil phosphatase activities and microbial respiration rates in freshwater soils decreased with elevated salinity. Elevated salinity increased arylsulfatase activities and microbial biomass C in brackish soils, and elevated P increased microbial respiration rates in brackish soils. Freshwater soil %C, %N, %P decreased and C:P and N:P increased with elevated salinity. Elevated P increased %C and C:N in freshwater soils and increased %P but decreased C:P and N:P in brackish soils. Freshwater soils released more C and nutrients than brackish soils when exposed to elevated salinity, and both soils were less responsive to elevated P than expected. Freshwater soils became more nutrient-depleted with elevated salinity, whereas brackish soils were unaffected by salinity but increased P uptake. Microbial activities in freshwater soils were inhibited by elevated salinity and unaffected by added P, but brackish soil microbial activities slightly increased with elevated salinity and P. © 2021 The Authors.",2021,,Ecosphere,12,8,,,10.1002/ecs2.3704,,#15254,Servais 2021,,
106,Effects of constant and fluctuating saltwater addition on CH4 fluxes and methanogens of a tidal freshwater wetland: A mesocosm study,"He, L.; She, C.; Huang, J.; Yang, P.; Yu, H.; Tong, C.","The importance of salinity in regulating CH4 emissions from coastal tidal wetlands has been widely recognized. However, the different effects of constant versus fluctuating salinity increases on CH4 emission and methanogens in both tidal freshwater marsh and floodplains are not yet well understood. We constructed mesocosm experiments on both a Cyperus malaccensis marsh and an adjacent non-vegetation-covered tidal floodplain over one year. We examined the effects of constant freshwater (CF), constant salinity (CS), and fluctuating salinity (FS) on porewater geochemistry, CH4 flux, methanogen abundance, diversity, and community structure in the tidal marsh and floodplain. Compared with CF treatment, methanogen abundance and Chao1 index were significantly lower in the marsh mesocosms under FS and CS treatment, but only in the floodplain mesocosms under CS treatment. CS treatment significantly reduced the proportion of Methanosarcinales but significantly increased the proportion of Methanobacteriales. Porewater SO42− and Cl− concentrations and pH were important factors affecting methanogen abundance and diversity. Both the CS and FS treatments considerably reduced CH4 fluxes in marsh and floodplain mesocosms; the main factor impacting CH4 flux was porewater dissolved CH4 concentration, and both methanogen abundance and Chao1 index were positively correlated with CH4 flux. Our results suggest that both continuous saltwater intrusion caused by sea-level rise and pulse saltwater intrusion perhaps caused by typhoons could reduce CH4 flux from subtropical estuarine tidal freshwater wetlands. © 2022",2022,,Estuar.

107,Shrub expansion in maritime forest responding to sea level rise,"Sward, R.; Philbrick, A.; Morreale, J.; Baird, C.J.; Gedan, K.","Expansion of shrubs has been observed in a number of biomes and in response to diverse global change drivers. Noting shrub expansion in coastal forests affected by sea level rise, we began to monitor shrub populations in a transgressing loblolly pine forest in coastal Virginia. Forest study plots spanned a gradient of salinity and progression toward a ghost forest state, from high forest with a relatively closed canopy, to mid and low forest, where there were few remaining live canopy trees. Shrubs of the species Morella cerifera were censused for 3 years from 2019 to 2021. Shrub distributions were compared to distributions of the invasive grass Phragmites australis to test if competition with this invasive species played a role in the observed shrub distribution. Shrubs were most abundant in the mid forest, whereas P. australis was most abundant in the low forest, but we did not detect a negative correlation between changes in occupancy of P. australis and shrubs. Rapid growth of shrubs in the mid and high forest radically changed the forest understory structure during the study period. Basal area of shrubs in the mid and high forest tripled, and shrub occupancy increased from 45 to 66% in the high forest, with high patchiness between plots. A flooding event salinized the site in late 2019, during the study. Following the flood, soil porewater salinities in the low forest remained above levels known to cause mortality in M. cerifera for several months. We postulate that high salinity, rather than competition with P. australis, filters M. cerifera from the low forest, whereas moderate salinity in the mid and high forest favors M. cerifera growth and expansion. The increase in shrubs appears to be a hallmark of salt-affected maritime forest, with the shrub front occurring in advance of other indicators of transgression such as P. australis invasion.

108,Novel microbial community composition and carbon biogeochemistry emerge over time following saltwater intrusion in wetlands,"Dang, C.; Morrissey, E.M.; Neubauer, S.C.; Franklin, R.B.","Sea level rise and changes in precipitation can cause saltwater intrusion into historically freshwater wetlands, leading to shifts in microbial metabolism that alter greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Saltwater intrusion modifies soil physicochemistry and can immediately affect microbial metabolism, but further alterations to biogeochemical processing can occur over time as microbial communities adapt to the changed environmental conditions. To assess temporal changes in microbial community composition and biogeochemical activity due to saltwater intrusion, soil cores were transplanted from a tidal freshwater marsh to a downstream mesohaline marsh and periodically sampled over 1 year. This experimental saltwater intrusion produced immediate changes in carbon mineralization rates, whereas shifts in the community composition developed more gradually. Salinity affected the composition of the prokaryotic community but did not exert a strong influence on the community composition of fungi. After only 1 week of saltwater exposure, carbon dioxide production doubled and methane production decreased by three orders of magnitude. By 1 month, carbon dioxide production in the transplant was comparable to the saltwater controls. Over time, we observed a partial recovery in methane production which strongly correlated with an increase in the relative abundance of three orders of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Taken together, our results suggest that ecosystem responses to saltwater intrusion are dynamic over time as complex interactions develop between microbial communities and the soil organic carbon pool. The gradual changes in microbial community structure we observed suggest that previously freshwater wetlands may not experience an equilibration of ecosystem function until long after initial saltwater intrusion. Our results suggest that during this transitional period, likely lasting years to decades, these ecosystems may exhibit enhanced greenhouse gas production through greater soil respiration and continued methanogenesis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2019,,Global Change Biol.,25,2,549-561,,10.1111/gcb.14486,,#15305,Dang 2019,,

Accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) associated to the warming climate is also affecting coastal wetlands, particularly in islands with limited coastal plains. We analyzed coastal wetland changes in Puerto Rico by applying the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model under two scenarios by 2100. We also analyzed mortality and recruitment in a freshwater swamp dominated by the tree Pterocarpus officinalis Jacq. in the context of landscape saltwater-intrusion and drought. Our results indicate mangroves and estuarine water would replace the areas currently covered by other saltwater and freshwater wetlands, and saltmarsh would encounter the most relative loss among wetland types. A moderate SLR of 1 m by 2100 allows expansion of mangroves but would decrease saltmarsh and freshwater wetlands. A 2-m SLR would decrease the distributions of all vegetated wetlands, mostly replaced by estuarine water. In the P. officinalis forest, saltwater-intrusion and drought increased tree mortality during 2003–2015 compared to 1994–2003. Saltwater intrusion had a more significant negative effect on tree recruitment than on mortality in this Pterocarpus forest.

Wetland species are expanding into declining forested communities, primarily dominated by trees. Higher salinities for germination may preclude establishment of tree species. We examined the capacity for coastal tree species (Acer rubrum, Liquidambar styraciflua, Pinus taeda, Celtis occidentalis, Persea borbonia) and a wetland shrub (Morella cerifera) to germinate at salinity concentrations of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ppt. A growth chamber experiment was established examining the effect of salinity on germination of common species found in mixed forests throughout the mid-Atlantic coastal plain and Gulf of Mexico, USA. The study revealed that regeneration from seed will be difficult for most of the selected species at salinities >5 ppt with implications for community composition with continued saltwater intrusion. Germination of A. rubrum was not impacted at higher salinities, with Pinus taeda not as affected other species. Morella cerifera did not have an advantage at the germination stage over selected tree species.

We measured the shear strength of marsh soils along a salinity and biodiversity gradient in the York River estuary in Virginia to assess the direct and indirect impacts of salinity on potential marsh erodibility. We found that soil shear strength was higher in monospecific salt marshes (5-36 kPa) than in biodiverse freshwater marshes (4-8 kPa), likely driven by differences in belowground biomass. However, we also found that shear strength at the marsh edge was controlled by sediment characteristics, rather than vegetation or salinity, suggesting that inherent relationships may be obscured in more dynamic environments. Our results indicate that York River freshwater marsh soils are weaker than salt marsh soils, and suggest that salinization of these freshwater marshes may lead to simultaneous losses in biodiversity and erodibility.

112,"Effects of Marsh Migration on Flooding, Saltwater Intrusion, and Crop Yield in Coastal Agricultural Land Subject to Storm Surge Inundation","Guimond, J.A.; Michael, H.A.","Low-lying coastlines are vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surge salinization, threatening the sustainability of coastal farmland. Most crops are intolerant of salinity, and minimization of saltwater intrusion is critical to crop preservation. Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including attenuation of storm surges. However, most research studying coastal protection by marshes neglects consideration of subsurface salinization. Here, we use two-dimensional, variable-density, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological models to explore how coastal wetlands affect surface and subsurface salinization due to storm surges. We evaluate how marsh width, surge height, and upland slope impact the magnitude of saltwater intrusion and the effect of marsh migration into farmland on crop yield. Results suggest that along topographically low coastlines subject to storm surges, marsh migration into agricultural fields prolongs the use of fields landward of the marsh while also protecting groundwater quality. Under a storm surge height of 3.0 m above mean sea level or higher and terrestrial slope of 0.1%, marsh migration of 200 and 400 m protects agricultural yield landward of the marsh-farmland interface compared to scenarios without migration, despite the loss of arable land. Economic calculations show that the maintained yields with 200 m of marsh migration may benefit farmers financially. However, yields are not maintained with migration widths over 400 m or surge height under 3.0 m above mean sea level. Results highlight the environmental and economic benefits of marsh migration and the need for more robust compensation programs for landowners incorporating coastal wetland development as a management strategy. © 2020.

The model results agreed well with field measurements and revealed that with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, the mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity (>2 psu) increased significantly compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services of TFFW even in the absence of SLR. Model results also showed more severe salinity stress under drought for the lower forest sites along the two rivers, where soil salinity values have already been at or in exceedance of the 2 psu threshold. ©2020.

114,Seeds of change: Characterizing the soil seed bank of a migrating salt marsh,"Kottler, E.J.; Gedan, K.","• Background and Aims The capacity for dispersal to promote or hinder species’ responses to global change remains a major question in ecology. One ecosystem experiencing rapid change is the tidal marsh, which is migrating inland in response to accelerated sea level rise. Few studies to date have investigated the ecological dynamics that impact this large-scale migration. Seed dispersal and persistence in the soil seed bank is a component that can be strongly indicative of community trajectories. With this in mind, the aim of our study was to characterize the germinable seed bank across a marsh–forest ecotone in the Chesapeake Bay. • Methods Soil samples were collected across transects that ran from the high marsh to the coastal loblolly pine forest in a brackish marsh in Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, MD, USA. Samples were grown in a greenhouse and watered with either freshwater or 3 ppt seawater solution. We compared community composition across transects and between salinity treatments. Additionally, we compared the seed bank with standing vegetation and used seed trait data from the TRY Database to investigate changes in functional traits along this ecotone. • Key Results We found halophytic species dispersing up to 15 m into the forest and a general lack of obligate upland species, including near absence of Pinus taeda, the dominant species in the forest canopy. A majority of species detected in the seed bank were wetland species of various types, with species with wide salinity tolerance arising most frequently. Salinity addition had a significant negative influence on seed bank diversity. • Conclusion Overall, our seed bank results suggest that dispersal and germination under the conditions of saltwater intrusion will limit forest regeneration and favour marsh plant dispersal. This indicates that the ecological processes that determine the soil seed bank community will support continued migration of marsh species into uplands. © The Author(s) 2019.

Accelerated sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands increase salinity and inundation depth, causing uncertain effects on plant and soil processes that drive C storage. We exposed peat-soil monoliths with sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) plants from a brackish marsh to continuous treatments of salinity (elevated (~ 20 ppt) vs. ambient (~ 10 ppt)) and inundation levels (submerged (water above soil surface) vs. exposed (water level 4 cm below soil surface)) for 18 months. We quantified changes in soil biogeochemistry, plant productivity, and whole-ecosystem C flux (gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; ecosystem respiration, ER). Elevated salinity had no effect on soil CO2 and CH4 efflux, but it reduced ER and GEP by 42 and 72%, respectively. Control monoliths exposed to ambient salinity had greater net ecosystem productivity (NEP), storing up to nine times more C than plants and soils exposed to elevated salinity. Submersion suppressed soil CO2 efflux but had no effect on NEP.

Annual litterfall and stem wood growth were summed to estimate ANPP. The DBH of live and dead individuals of understory shrubs were measured to calculate density, basal area (BA), and important values (IV). Freshwater forest communities clearly differed in composition, structure, tree size, BA, and productivity across the salinity gradient. The higher salinity plots had decreased numbers of tree species, density, and BA. Higher salinity reduced average ANPP. The dominant tree species and their relative densities did not change along the salinity gradient, but the dominance of the primary tree species differed with increasing salinity. Baldcypress was the predominant tree species with highest density, DBH, BA, IV, and contribution to total ANPP on all sites. Mean growth rate of baldcypress trees decreased with increasing salinity, but exhibited the greatest growth among all tree species. While the overall number of shrub species decreased with increasing salinity, wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) density, DBH, BA, and IV increased with salinity. With rising sea level and increasing salinity levels, low regeneration of baldcypress, and the invasion of wax myrtle, typical successional patterns in TFFW and forest health are likely to change in the future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2017,,For.

However, to what extent wetland C cycling will be affected by accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion is unknown, especially in coastal peat marshes where water flow is highly managed. Our objective was to determine how the ecosystem C balance in coastal peat marshes is influenced by elevated salinity. For two years, we made monthly in situ manipulations of elevated salinity in freshwater (FW) and brackish water (BW) sites within Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. Salinity pulses interacted with marsh-specific variability in seasonal hydroperiods whereby effects of elevated pulsed salinity on gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) were dependent on marsh inundation level. We found little effect of elevated salinity on C cycling when both marsh sites were inundated, but when water levels receded below the soil surface, the BW marsh shifted from a C sink to a C source. During these exposed periods, we observed an approximately threefold increase in CO2 efflux from the marsh as a result of elevated salinity. Initially, elevated salinity pulses did not affect Cladium jamaicense biomass, but aboveground biomass began to be significantly decreased in the saltwater amended plots after two years of exposure at the BW site. We found a 65% (FW) and 72% (BW) reduction in live root biomass in the soil after two years of exposure to elevated salinity pulses. Regardless of salinity treatment, the FW site was C neutral while the BW site was a strong C source (−334 to −454 g C·m−2·yr−1), particularly during dry-down events. A loss of live roots coupled with annual net CO2 losses as marshes transition from FW to BW likely contributes to the collapse of peat soils observed in the coastal Everglades. As SLR increases the rate of saltwater intrusion into coastal wetlands globally, understanding how water management influences C gains and losses from these systems is crucial. Under current Everglades’ water management, drought lengthens marsh dry-down periods, which, coupled with saltwater intrusion, accelerates CO2 loss from the marsh. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America",2018,,Ecol.

118,Predicting impacts of sea level rise on wintering redhead ducks along the lower Texas Coast,"Lange, C.J.; Collins, D.P.; Metzger, K.L.; Ballard, B.M.","The potential impacts of sea level rise to wildlife populations and their habitats are of concern. Localized relative sea levels have been rising at elevated rates compared to global sea levels, and this trend will impact coastal plant communities, particularly wetlands. The Laguna Madre, a hypersaline lagoon, is home to nearly 80% of North America's redheads (Aythya americana) during winter. The large, shallow lagoon provides optimal growing conditions for seagrasses, including shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii), the redhead's primary winter food. Adjacent to the Laguna Madre are coastal ponds, on which redheads rely for fresh water. The close proximity of these freshwater sources to the coast makes them vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise. Using Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM), we modeled the impacts of sea level rise on coastal ponds and foraging areas along the lower Texas coast through the year 2100. We also determined which coastal habitat types would be most affected by rising sea levels. The SLAMM model indicated that 9 land cover types had a ≥50% change in occurrence from the initial 1999 time period to 2100. The model also predicted that 93 of the known 156 coastal ponds would become inundated with salt water. The predicted loss of foraging habitat and its typical proximity to coastal ponds creates a need to identify where conservation and enhancement of wintering redhead habitat should be placed to mitigate the effects of sea level rise. © 2018",2018,,Glob.

119,Tidal marsh plant community response to sea-level rise: A mesocosm study,"Sharpe, P.J.; Baldwin, A.H.","Recent evidence from field surveys suggests that periodic saline intrusions into tidal freshwater wetlands may not reduce plant species richness and that reductions in richness may not occur until a more consistent brackish salinity regime develops. In a greenhouse experiment using tidal wetland mesocosms, we tested the hypothesis that plant species richness of coastal marshes (wetlands dominated by herbaceous plants) would be similar under oligohaline (0.5-5) and freshwater conditions (<0.5) (psu; practical salinity units), provided that propagules of salt-tolerant species were present. We also hypothesized that plant community responses would depend on inundation frequency. Species richness was highest in fresh and oligohaline treatments (<5, 11-13 species per mesocosm) and decreased with increasing salinity up to 12. Inundation frequency did not significantly influence species richness. Aboveground biomass decreased weakly as salinity increased, but the difference between salinity treatments was significant only at the 0.1 level. Flooding did not significantly alter aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass was not significantly influenced by either salinity or flooding treatments (. P<. 0.05). Biomass of individual species and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis indicated a shift toward salt-tolerant plant communities with increasing salinity, but detected little influence of inundation. These findings suggest that species composition shifts may prevent strong reductions in biomass due to loss of individual species as salinity increases, and that community composition will change more rapidly in response to increases in salinity than to inundation increases. Also, saltwater intrusions into low-salinity marshes of up to 6 will not create an immediate and significant reduction in species richness assuming propagules of salt-tolerant plants are available and given the tolerance of many Fresh/Oligohaline species observed in this study to salinity levels ≥6. However, the species composition of fresh and oligohaline wetlands can shift toward a less species-rich brackish plant community within a single growing season under prolonged salinity exposures of 12. © 2012 .",2012,,Aquatic Bot.,101,,34-40,,10.1016/j.aquabot.2012.03.015,,#15495,Sharpe 2012,,

To determine the potential contribution of saltwater intrusion to the observed species transition, we conducted a mesocosm study subjecting Spartina and two TFM perennials (Peltandra virginica and Leersia oryzoides) to sub-lethal levels of salinity (0, 2, 4 and 6). We measured plant performance as carbon dioxide flux over the leaf stomata as a proxy for net photosynthesis (Anet), aboveground and belowground biomass and tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. For Spartina, all metrics were unchanged across the range of tested salinity. The TFM species, however, had lower Anet than Spartina and decreased with added salinity. TFM biomass was reduced up to 86 % in both the aboveground and belowground compartments, and aboveground nutrient allocation was altered: N increased in Leersia and P increased in Peltandra with increasing salinity. Under this simulation of increased salt intrusion associated with climate change and sea level rise, TFM species responded with decreased biomass and decreased tissue C:N. Although other factors must contribute, the abiotic salt stressor leads to plant responses consistent with the observed replacement of TFM species by Spartina. © 2013 Society of Wetland Scientists.",2014,,Wetlands,34,1,167-175,,10.1007/s13157-013-0494-x,,#15507,Sutter 2014,,

This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2014,,Hydrobiologia,726,1,195-211,,10.1007/s10750-013-1764-6,,#15514,Chambers 2014,,
122,"Changes in wetland forest structure, basal growth, and composition across a tidal gradient","Anderson, C.J.; Lockaby, B.G.; Click, N.","Because of their proximity to oceanic waters, freshwater tidal forests are susceptible to impacts from future climate change and sea level rise. These wetlands are historically understudied and we conducted our study to improve the understanding of structural changes in forested wetlands as they become tidally influenced. Using 20 forested stands across a tidal gradient on the lower Apalachicola River, Florida we examined changes in forest structure (tree density, size classes), basal growth, sapling/shrub cover and richness, understory cover/richness, and coarse woody debris. Tidal wetlands had greater tree (>2.5 cm DBH) density compared to nontidal forests (1446 ± 159 and 962 ± 100 stems ha-1, respectively) and more small trees (2.5 to 5.0 cm DBH) (699 and 359 stems ha-1, respectively). Over a 3 y period (2007 to 2010), basal area increment ranged from -0.07 to 0.30 m 2 ha-1 y-1 for tidal wetlands and 0.07 to 0.55 m2 ha-1 y-1 for nontidal wetlands. Both forests experienced tree mortality during the study that influenced basal area. Tidal wetland tree mortality appeared to result from saltwater intrusion while several nontidal forest plots were affected by downed trees during a winter wind storm. Mean sapling/shrub (<2.5 cm DBH) density and richness in tidal forests were more than twice that estimated for nontidal forests. Mean herbaceous cover in tidal wetlands (72 ± 4%) was significantly higher than nontidal forests (19 ± 4%) and dominated by perennial herbaceous plants as opposed to nontidal wetlands that were often dominated by tree seedlings. Mean, large, coarse, woody, debris biomass (>7.62 cm diameter) was significantly lower in tidal wetlands compared to nontidal wetlands.

123,Sea-level rise vulnerability in the countries of the Coral Triangle,"Mcleod, E.; Hinkel, J.; Vafeidis, A.T.; Nicholls, R.J.; Harvey, N.; Salm, R.","Sea-level rise is a major threat facing the Coral Triangle countries in the twenty-first century. Assessments of vulnerability and adaptation that consider the interactions among natural and social systems are critical to identifying habitats and communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and for supporting the development of adaptation strategies. This paper presents such an assessment using the DIVA model and identifies vulnerable coastal regions and habitats in Coral Triangle countries at national and sub-national levels (administrative provinces). The following four main sea-level rise impacts are assessed in ecological, social and economic terms over the twenty-first century: (1) coastal wetland change, (2) increased coastal flooding, (3) increased coastal erosion, and (4) saltwater intrusion into estuaries and deltas. The results suggest that sea-level rise will significantly affect coastal regions and habitats in the Coral Triangle countries, but the impacts will differ across the region in terms of people flooded annually, coastal wetland change and loss, and damage and adaptation costs. Indonesia is projected to be most affected by coastal flooding, with nearly 5. 9 million people expected to experience flooding annually in 2100 assuming no adaptation. However, if adaptation is considered, this number is significantly reduced. By the end of the century, coastal wetland loss is most significant for Indonesia in terms of total area lost, but the Solomon Islands are projected to experience the greatest relative loss of coastal wetlands. Damage costs associated with sea-level rise are highest in the Philippines (US $6. 5 billion/year) and lowest in the Solomon Islands (US $70,000/year). Adaptation is estimated to reduce damage costs significantly, in particular for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia (between 68 and 99%). These results suggest that the impacts of sea-level rise are likely to be widespread in the region and adaptation measures must be broadly applied. © 2010 Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer.",2010,,Sustainability Sci.,5,2,207-222,,10.1007/s11625-010-0105-1,,#15549,Mcleod 2010,,
124,The role of genetic structure in the adaptive divergence of populations experiencing saltwater intrusion due to relative sea-level rise,"Purcell, K.M.; Hitch, A.; Martin, S.; Klerks, P.L.; Leberg, P.L.","Saltwater intrusion into estuaries creates stressful conditions for nektonic species. Previous studies have shown that Gambusia affinis populations with exposure to saline environments develop genetic adaptations for increased survival during salinity stress. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of G. affinis populations, previously shown to have adaptations for increased salinity tolerance, and determine the impact of selection and gene flow on structure of these populations. We found that gene flow was higher between populations experiencing different salinity regimes within an estuary than between similar marsh types in different estuaries, suggesting the development of saline-tolerant phenotypes due to local adaptation. There was limited evidence of genetic structure along a salinity gradient, and only some of the genetic variation among sites was correlated with salinity. Our results suggest limited structure, combined with selection to saltwater intrusion, results in phenotypic divergence in spite of a lack of physical barriers to gene flow. © 2012 The Authors.

In many areas, tidal saltwater forests (mangroves) contrastingly are expanding landward in subtropical coastal reaches succeeding freshwater marsh and forest zones. Hydrological characteristics of these low-relief coastal forests in intertidal settings are dictated by the influence of tidal and freshwater forcing. In this paper, we describe the application of the Sea Level Over Proportional Elevation (SLOPE) model to predict coastal forest retreat and migration from projected sea-level rise based on a proxy relationship of saltmarsh/mangrove area and tidal range. The SLOPE model assumes that the sum area of saltmarsh/mangrove habitat along any given coastal reach is determined by the slope of the landform and vertical tide forcing. Model results indicated that saltmarsh and mangrove migration from sea-level rise will vary by county and watershed but greater in western Gulf States than in the eastern Gulf States where millions of hectares of coastal forest will be displaced over the next century with a near meter rise in relative sea level alone. Substantial losses of coastal forests will also occur in the eastern Gulf but mangrove forests in subtropical zones of Florida are expected to replace retreating freshwater forest and affect regional biodiversity. Accelerated global eustacy from climate change will compound the degree of predicted retreat and migration of coastal forests with expected implications for ecosystem management of State and Federal lands in the absence of adaptive coastal management.",2010,,For.

In particular, the swamp forests of Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, have degraded considerably, and research regarding their condition might suggest approaches for their restoration. We measured forest structure, species composition, tree mortality, annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of woody species, and aboveground biomass allocation to leaf litter and wood, and soil strength at forty study plots within the Lake Maurepas basin over 5 years to evaluate the current condition of this coastal forested wetland. Local measures of salinity and regional measures of flooding were used to predict ANPP and aboveground biomass allocation. The 5-year study period included an intense drought as well as years characterized by hurricane-induced flooding. The forty study plots could be divided into four distinct habitat clusters based on standing biomass, structural variables, and salinity. The majority of the plots were co-dominated by Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica. Acer rubrum var. drummondii and Fraxinus pennsylvanica were common mid-story species throughout the western and southern parts of the study area, while Salix nigra, Morella cerifera, and Triadica sebiferum were more important at the more degraded plots in the eastern part of the basin. Annual mean soil salinity reached unprecedented level (2-5 psu) during the drought and cumulative tree mortality reached up to 85% in areas characterized by frequent saltwater intrusions. The ANPP was higher during the drought period in 2000-2001 than during subsequent years, and was dominated by T. distichum. At most sampling plots, litter production exceeded wood production annually. A negative correlation between aboveground biomass allocation to litter and flooding indicated that biomass allocation shifted from litter toward wood during wet years. Overall, the majority of the plots sampled produced less than 400 g m-2 yr-1 of aboveground biomass annually due to the interacting negative effects of saltwater intrusion and prolonged flooding with nutrient-poor water. Reintroduction of Mississippi River water to the Maurepas system has the potential to benefit these swamps greatly by restoring a greater flow of nutrients, sediments, and fresh water through the wetlands. The historically slow (i.e., multi-decadal) process of swamp deterioration was greatly sped by low salinity (i.e., 2-5 psu) saltwater intrusions during a drought in 1999-2000. The majority of the coastal swamps in the Pontchartrain Basin are deteriorating, and most of this swamp area will be lost to open water in the foreseeable future if no restoration action is taken. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As water level increases, saltwater encroaches farther inland in many coastal areas. Responses of Gulf of Mexico coastal tree species to increased flooding and saltwater intrusion is evaluated. A review of investigations which address changes in morphological characteristics and carbon assimilation rates under short-term flooding and/or salinity conditions is presented. The combination of flooding and salinity causes foliage damage and substantial reductions in carbon assimilation. The morphological response and reductions in gas exchange rates are closely associated with increases in salt levels. Exposure to salt concentrations greater than 50 mol m-3 (3 ppt) causes some leaf burning and decline in carbon assimilation rates of up to 84% in seedlings of some species. Results indicated that increased flooding and saltwater intrusion, a problem facing U.S. Golf Coast bottomland forests, can cause drastic reduction in net carbon assimilation, leaf burning and seedling mortality. The stress at sublethal levels can lead to weaker seedlings and, consequently, reduced survival rates, and the potential for long-term habitat changes thus limiting the existing natural range of these forests. © 1990.",1990,,For.

129,Impact of sea-level rise on sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers,"Werner, A.D.; Simmons, C.T.","Despite its purported importance, previous studies of the influence of sea-level rise on coastal aquifers have focused on specific sites, and a generalized systematic analysis of the general case of the sea water intrusion response to sea-level rise has not been reported. In this study, a simple conceptual framework is used to provide a first-order assessment of sea water intrusion changes in coastal unconfined aquifers in response to sea-level rise. Two conceptual models are tested: (1) flux-controlled systems, in which ground water discharge to the sea is persistent despite changes in sea level, and (2) head-controlled systems, whereby ground water abstractions or surface features maintain the head condition in the aquifer despite sea-level changes. The conceptualization assumes steady-state conditions, a sharp interface sea water-fresh water transition zone, homogeneous and isotropic aquifer properties, and constant recharge. In the case of constant flux conditions, the upper limit for sea water intrusion due to sea-level rise (up to 1.5 m is tested) is no greater than 50 m for typical values of recharge, hydraulic conductivity, and aquifer depth. This is in striking contrast to the constant head cases, in which the magnitude of salt water toe migration is on the order of hundreds of meters to several kilometers for the same sea-level rise. This study has highlighted the importance of inland boundary conditions on the sea-level rise impact. It identifies combinations of hydrogeologic parameters that control whether large or small salt water toe migration will occur for any given change in a hydrogeologic variable. © 2009 National Ground Water Association.",2009,,Ground Water,47,2,197-204,,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2008.00535.x,,#15650,Werner 2009,,

131,Causal mechanisms of soil organic matter decomposition: deconstructing salinity and flooding impacts in coastal wetlands,"Stagg, C.L.; Schoolmaster, D.R.; Krauss, K.W.; Cormier, N.; Conner, W.H.","Coastal wetlands significantly contribute to global carbon storage potential. Sea-level rise and other climate-change-induced disturbances threaten coastal wetland sustainability and carbon storage capacity. It is critical that we understand the mechanisms controlling wetland carbon loss so that we can predict and manage these resources in anticipation of climate change. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that control soil organic matter decomposition, in particular the impacts of elevated salinity, are limited, and literature reports are contradictory. In an attempt to improve our understanding of these complex processes, we measured root and rhizome decomposition and developed a causal model to identify and quantify the mechanisms that influence soil organic matter decomposition in coastal wetlands that are impacted by sea-level rise. We identified three causal pathways: (1) a direct pathway representing the effects of flooding on soil moisture, (2) a direct pathway representing the effects of salinity on decomposer microbial communities and soil biogeochemistry, and (3) an indirect pathway representing the effects of salinity on litter quality through changes in plant community composition over time. We used this model to test the effects of alternate scenarios on the response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands and oligohaline marshes to short- and long-term climate-induced disturbances of flooding and salinity. In tidal freshwater forested wetlands, the model predicted less decomposition in response to drought, hurricane salinity pulsing, and long-term sea-level rise. In contrast, in the oligohaline marsh, the model predicted no change in response to drought and sea-level rise, and increased decomposition following a hurricane salinity pulse. Our results show that it is critical to consider the temporal scale of disturbance and the magnitude of exposure when assessing the effects of salinity intrusion on carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands. Here, we identify three causal mechanisms that can reconcile disparities between long-term and short-term salinity impacts on organic matter decomposition. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America",2017,,Ecology,98,8,2003-2018,,10.1002/ecy.1890,,#15721,Stagg 2017,,

Sea level rise can increase the extent of brackish water intrusion into freshwater ecosystems, which in turn can affect the structure and function of resident microbial communities. In this study, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment using intact tidal freshwater marsh sediment cores to examine the effect of a 5-part per thousand (ppt) salinity increase on the diversity and community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. We used a clone library approach to examine the dsrA gene, which encodes an important catalytic enzyme in sulfate reduction. Our results indicate that tidal freshwater marshes contain extremely diverse communities of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Members of these communities were, on average, only 71 % similar to known cultured sulfate reducers and 81 % similar to previously sequenced environmental clones. Salinity and associated increases in sulfate availability did not significantly affect the diversity or community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. However, carbon quality and quantity, which correlated with depth, were found to be the strongest drivers of sulfate-reducing community structure. Our study demonstrates that the sulfate-reducing community in tidal freshwater marsh sediments appears resistant to increased salinity in the face of sea level rise. Additionally, the microorganisms that comprise this sulfate-reducing community appear to be unique to tidal freshwater marsh sediments and may represent novel lineages of previously undescribed sulfate reducers. © 2016, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.",2016,,Estuar.

134,Impacts of sea-level rise on estuarine circulation: An idealized estuary and San Francisco Bay,"Chua, V.P.; Xu, M.","Estuaries lie at the interface of land and sea, and are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise due to climate change that might lead to intrusion of salt water further upstream and affect circulation patterns. Climate change is also likely to have a major impact on hydrological cycles and consequently lead to changes in freshwater inflows into estuaries. An idealized estuary model is employed to investigate the effects of sea-level rise and freshwater inflows on estuarine circulation. Rising sea levels result in a stronger longitudinal salinity gradient. x, indicating an increase in the strength of the gravitational circulation UGC, higher longitudinal dispersion coefficients K and enhanced salinity intrusion. Under low-flow conditions, the effects of sea level rise on salinity intrusion are largest because sea-level rise has a greater impact due to weaker vertical stratification. Strong flows increase the strength of the gravitational circulation, resulting in higher vertical stratification, which leads to the nonlinear feedback between vertical mixing and stratification. The effect of sea-level rise on salinity intrusion is reduced owing to the suppression of mixing by stratification. Supporting three-dimensional simulations from northern San Francisco Bay are presented. The intrusion length scale L is used as a substitute for regulating inflows to ensure that sufficient fresh water is available to flush the Bay. Following a set of standards explicitly stated in the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord, a series of simulations is performed and we find that with sea-level rise stronger inflows are required to maintain L at the proposed locations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,,J.

Measurements of hydrology, nutrients, and aboveground net primary productivity were made from September 1998 through March 2002. Accretion measurements were made in October 2000 and October 2004. The major hydrologic inputs to the system were the effluent, precipitation, and back water flooding from Lake Pontchartrain. Nutrient levels were generally low except in the immediate vicinity of the outfall. Mean net primary production of the freshwater forest system was significantly higher downstream of the effluent discharge (1202 g m-2 yr-1) compared to the control site (799 g m-2 yr-1). Downstream of the outfall, accretion rates were double the rate of relative sea level rise in the area. Removal efficiencies of N and P were as high as 75% and 95%, respectively. The relatively constant flow of secondarily treated municipal effluent buffered the downstream area from salinity intrusion during a region-wide drought. Re-direction of nutrient-enhanced effluents from open water bodies to wetland ecosystems can maintain plant productivity, sequester carbon, and maintain coastal wetland elevations in response to sea-level rise in addition to improving overall surface water quality, reducing energy use, and increasing financial savings.",2008,,Ecol.

136,Can elevated CO 2 modify regeneration from seed banks of floating freshwater marshes subjected to rising sea-level?,"Middleton, B.A.; McKee, K.L.","Higher atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 can offset the negative effects of flooding or salinity on plant species, but previous studies have focused on mature, rather than regenerating vegetation. This study examined how interacting environments of CO 2, water regime, and salinity affect seed germination and seedling biomass of floating freshwater marshes in the Mississippi River Delta, which are dominated by C 3 grasses, sedges, and forbs. Germination density and seedling growth of the dominant species depended on multifactor interactions of CO 2 (385 and 720 μl l -1) with flooding (drained, +8-cm depth, +8-cm depth-gradual) and salinity (0, 6% seawater) levels. Of the three factors tested, salinity was the most important determinant of seedling response patterns. Species richness (total = 19) was insensitive to CO 2. Our findings suggest that for freshwater marsh communities, seedling response to CO 2 is species-specific and secondary to salinity and flooding effects. Elevated CO 2 did not ameliorate flooding or salinity stress. Consequently, climate-related changes in sea level or human-caused alterations in hydrology may override atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in driving shifts in this plant community. The results of this study suggest caution in making extrapolations from species-specific responses to community-level predictions without detailed attention to the nuances of multifactor responses. © 2012 The Author(s).",2012,,Hydrobiologia,683,1,123-133,,10.1007/s10750-011-0946-3,,#15796,Middleton 2012,,
137,"Assessment of salinity intrusion in the James and Chickahominy Rivers as a result of simulated sea-level rise in Chesapeake Bay, East Coast, USA","Rice, K.C.; Hong, B.; Shen, J.","Global sea level is rising, and the relative rate in the Chesapeake Bay region of the East Coast of the United States is greater than the worldwide rate. Sea-level rise can cause saline water to migrate upstream in estuaries and rivers, threatening freshwater habitat and drinking-water supplies. The effects of future sea-level rise on two tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, the James and Chickahominy (CHK) Rivers, were evaluated in order to quantify the salinity change with respect to the magnitude of sea-level rise. Such changes are critical to: 1) local floral and faunal habitats that have limited tolerance ranges to salinity; and 2) a drinking-water supply for the City of Newport News, Virginia. By using the three-dimensional Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model (HEM-3D), sea-level rise scenarios of 30, 50, and 100 cm, based on the U.S. Climate Change Science Program for the mid-Atlantic region for the 21st century, were evaluated. The model results indicate that salinity increases in the entire river as sea level rises and that the salinity increase in a dry year is greater than that in a typical year. In the James River, the salinity increase in the middle-to-upper river (from 25 to 50 km upstream of the mouth) is larger than that in the lower and upper parts of the river. The maximum mean salinity increase would be 2 and 4 ppt for a sea-level rise of 50 and 100 cm, respectively. The upstream movement of the 10 ppt isohaline is much larger than the 5 and 20 ppt isohalines. The volume of water with salinity between 10 and 20 ppt would increase greatly if sea level rises 100 cm. In the CHK River, with a sea-level rise of 100 cm, the mean salinity at the drinking-water intake 34 km upstream of the mouth would be about 3 ppt in a typical year and greater than 5 ppt in a dry year, both far in excess of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's secondary standard for total dissolved solids for drinking water. At the drinking-water intake, the number of days of salinity greater than 0.1 ppt increases with increasing sea-level rise; during a dry year, 0.1 ppt would be exceeded for more than 100 days with as small a rise as 30 cm. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,,J.

The sites, located along transects from the marshland to the inner forest, are representative of the progressive forest retreat and the consequent marsh expansion driven by sea level rise. The sites are divided in marsh, transition zone where marsh vegetation is invading the forest, low forest, where tree dieback is widespread, intermediate forest (medium forest), where trees show signs of stress, and high forest, where trees are healthy. Sea level rise and storm surge events are the drivers of the forest conversion to salt marsh. Groundwater level and electrical conductivity were measured in a well at each site. Soil water content and electrical conductivity data were measured in the first 7-cm layer of soil. Weather and light data were collected to determine the effects of external inputs on groundwater and soil moisture datasets and to relate hydrological variables and illuminance to local ecology. Data collected are fundamental to estimate feedbacks between hydrology and ecology in the study area and to quantify forest retreat due to flooding and salinization. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,,Data Brief,45,,,,10.1016/j.dib.2022.108584,,#15813,Nordio 2022,,
139,Salinity increases with water table elevation at the boundary between salt marsh and forest,"Nordio, G.; Fagherazzi, S.","The migration of salt marshes into forests along coastal regions is nowadays well documented. Sea level rise and storms threaten coastal forests by increasing groundwater levels and salinity. Salinization is the main cause of forest conversion to salt marsh in North America. In this paper we study groundwater levels and salinity in two wells installed at the border between forest and salt marsh in the lower Delmarva peninsula, USA. The upper well is located in the regenerative forest, where recruitment is still possible, while the lower well is located in the persistent forest, where only mature trees survive. Groundwater in the upper well is fresh at the root depth, while in the lower well the mean salinity is 8 ppt. Our data suggest that rainfall has an instantaneous effect on salinity and groundwater levels, but it does not affect salinity and groundwater levels on longer periods (weeks to months). Groundwater levels and salinity reflect the hydraulic gradient toward the marsh (a proxy for outgoing water fluxes), the uphill hydraulic gradient (a proxy for incoming water fluxes) and temperature (a proxy for evapotranspiration). Salinity increases when groundwater levels are high. To explain this result, we put forward the hypothesis that a high water table favors the flux of surficial, fresh water to the marsh, and loss of freshwater by evapotranspiration. These losses are likely replenished by saltier water moving at depth. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,J. Hydrol.,608,,,,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127576,,#15815,Nordio 2022,,

In low-lying coastal wetlands, sea level rise, a phenomenon caused by global climate change, is slowly degrading numerous healthy freshwater forested wetlands into salt-degraded counterparts with a nickname “ghost forests”, and eventually converting them to saltmarshes. However, little is known about the changes of mercury (Hg) methylation, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification along the forest-to-saltmarsh gradient. Here, we conducted extensive field sampling in three wetland states (healthy forested wetlands, salt-degraded forested wetlands, and saltmarsh) along a salinity gradient (from 0 to 9.4 ppt) in Winyah Bay, South Carolina, USA. We found that in our study wetland systems the saltmarshes had the lowest levels of both total Hg and MeHg in sediments and biota, as compared to healthy forested wetlands and saltwater-degraded ghost forests. Our results suggest that the slow conversion of forested wetland to saltmarsh could reduce net MeHg production in our study wetland systems, which we hypothesized that could be attributed to increased sulfate reduction and excessive buildup of sulfide in sediment that inhibits microbial Hg methylation, and/or reduced canopy density and increased photodegradation of MeHg. However, it should be noted that biogeochemical MeHg responses to salinity changes may be site-specific and we urge more similar studies in other wetland systems along a salinity gradient. Therefore, long-term salinization of coastal wetlands and the slow conversion of forests to marshes could decrease long-term exposure of toxic MeHg levels in coastal food webs that are similar to our system, and ultimately reduce human exposure to this neurotoxin. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Chemosphere,308,,,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136310,,#15837,Ulus 2022,,
141,Watershed and estuarine controls both influence plant community and tree growth changes in tidal freshwater forested wetlands along two u.S. mid-atlantic rivers,"Noe, G.B.; Bourg, N.A.; Krauss, K.W.; Duberstein, J.A.; Hupp, C.R.","The tidal freshwater zone near the estuarine head-of-tide is potentially sensitive to both sea-level rise and associated salinity increases as well as changing watershed inputs of freshwater and nutrients. We evaluated the vegetation response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) to changes in nontidal river versus estuarine controls along the longitudinal gradient of the Mat-taponi and Pamunkey rivers in the Mid-Atlantic USA. The gradient included nontidal freshwater floodplain (NT) and upper tidal (UT), lower tidal (LT), and stressed tidal forest transitioning to marsh (ST) TFFW habitats on both rivers. Plot-based vegetation sampling and dendrochronology were employed to examine: (1) downriver shifts in plant community composition and the structure of canopy trees, understory trees/saplings/shrubs and herbs, tree basal-area increment (BAI) and (2) interannual variability in BAI from 2015 dating back as far as 1969 in relation to long-term river and estuary monitoring data. With greater tidal influence downstream, tree species dominance shifted, live basal area generally decreased, long-term mean BAI of individual trees decreased, woody stem mortality increased, and live herbaceous vegetative cover and richness increased. Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Ilex opaca, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica dominated NT and UT sites, with F. pennsylvanica and Nyssa sylvatica increasingly dominating at more downstream tidal sites. Annual tree BAI growth was positively affected by nontidal river flow at NT and UT sites which were closer to the head-of-tide, positively influenced by small salinity increases at LT and ST sites further downstream, and positively influenced by estuarine water level throughout the gradient; nutrient influence was site specific with both positive and negative influences. The counterintuitive finding of salinity increasing tree growth at sites with low BAI is likely due to either competitive growth release from neighboring tree death or enhanced soil nutrient availability that may temporarily mitigate the negative effects of low-level salinization and sea-level increases on living TFFW canopy trees, even as overall plant community conversion to tidal marsh progresses. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we translocated soils collected from a tidal freshwater wetland to sites with varying salinities along a subtropical estuarine gradient and established unplanted and planted (with the salt-tolerant plant Cyperus malaccensis Lam.) mesocosms at each site. We simultaneously investigated cumulative soil CO2 emissions, C-acquiring enzyme activities, availability of labile organic C (LOC), and structures of bacterial and fungal communities. Overall, in the planted mesocosm, the soil LOC content and the activities of β-1,4-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase increased with salinization. However, in the unplanted mesocosm, soil LOC content decreased with increasing salinity, whereas all the C-acquiring enzyme activities did not change. In addition, salinization favored the dominance of bacterial and fungal copiotrophs (e.g., γ-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Ascomycota) in the planted mesocosms. Contrarily, in the unplanted mesocosms salinization favored bacterial and fungal oligotrophs (e.g., α-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Basidiomycota). In both planted and unplanted mesocosms, cumulative soil CO2 emissions were affected by soil LOC content, activities of C-acquiring enzymes, and microbial C-use trophic strategies. Overall, cumulative soil CO2 emissions increased by 35% with increasing salinity in the planted mesocosm but decreased by 37% as salinity increased in the unplanted mesocosm. Our results demonstrate that the presence or absence of salt-tolerant plants can moderate the effect of salinity on SOC mineralization in tidal wetland soils. Future C prediction models should embed both planted and unplanted modules to accurately simulate cycling of soil C in tidal wetlands under sea level rise. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Sci.

143,Implications of Sea Level Rise for Bee Communities in Rural Eastern Virginia Coastal Habitats,"Thuma, J.; Roulston, T.; Blum, L.","In the coastal mid-Atlantic region of the USA, landscapes are a mosaic of upland habitats (woodland, grassland, old fields and farmland) and low-lying coastal salt marsh. Flooding and salinization of coastal areas due to sea-level rise result in the conversion of upland habitats to salt marsh, and change the relative proportion of habitat types surrounding coastal farmland. This has the potential to influence population sizes of organisms living in this area and could alter the ecosystem services, such as pollination, that these habitats provide. To examine the potential outcome of these habitat conversions, we used blue vane traps at 14 sites along the Eastern Shore of Virginia (USA) to compare the bee communities of salt marsh, old fields and agricultural fields. Although there was no difference among habitat types for total bee abundance per site, we found that the coastal marsh is depauperate in bee species relative to old fields and agricultural fields, and that the bee species using the marsh habitat tend to be specialists of plant families that are common in the marsh (Asteraceae and Malvaceae) but are relatively uncommon in local agriculture. Thus, the transition of upland areas to marsh not only has the potential to impact agricultural productivity directly through salt water intrusion, ultimately it may also reduce the species richness of native bees available to provide pollination services to coastal agriculture.  © 2019 Kansas Entomological Society.",2019,,J.

Here we observe and model freshwater-seawater interactions in a first-order stream—floodplain system where tidal access was recently restored. Subsurface flow and transport modeling were used to quantify and better understand the interplay of processes, properties, and conditions that control water level and salinity in the floodplain to the tidal stream. Water levels in the stream were highly correlated with tidal forcing, which resulted in episodic inundation of the floodplain at quasi-monthly frequency. The tidal stream is the only source of salinity to the floodplain, yet shallow groundwater salinity was considerably higher than average stream salinity. The low-permeability clay floodplain soils limit lateral groundwater flow and transport, resulting in floodplain groundwater and salinity dynamics driven almost exclusively by infiltration during inundation events. As inundation occurs during high tide, estuarine waters reach the floodplain with minor attenuation in salinity from the stream's freshwater discharge. Infiltration and salinity exposure are topography controlled and regulated by ponding depth and duration, seasonal ground saturation, and depth to water table. The model suggests that floodplain salinity is currently in an early stage of transition from pre-restoration freshwater conditions and will not reach equilibrium for ~20 years. These findings have broad relevance for understanding how and over what time scales coastal ecosystems will respond to increasing seawater exposure from sea level rise, ocean-originating storms, and changes in natural and man-made barriers. ©2020.

145,Marsh bird occupancy along the shoreline-to-forest gradient as marshes migrate from rising sea level,"Taillie, P.J.; Moorman, C.E.","One mechanism by which coastal marshes may persist as sea-level rises is to expand landward into existing forest, a process known as marsh migration. Though recent studies highlight the importance of marsh migration to the conservation of birds associated with coastal marshes, marsh bird responses to this transition from forest to marsh are poorly understood. To address this need, we conducted surveys of five focal marsh bird taxa at 92 points distributed across the gradient from the shoreline to the marsh–forest interface in one of the most vulnerable regions to sea-level rise in North America where marshes have been migrating landward for at least several decades. Given this landward movement of the forest–marsh interface, we modeled focal taxa occurrence as a function of distance-to-forest, thereby assuming that marshes closer to the forest were newer than those closer to the shoreline. In addition, we investigated the effects of vegetation conditions and fire frequency. Occupancy probability of marsh birds decreased closer to the forest–marsh interface where woody vegetation was taller and herbaceous cover was dominated by Cladium jamaicense, suggesting migrated marsh may provide limited habitat for these bird species, at least in the short term. Though parameter estimate uncertainty for black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) was high due to a limited number of detections, occupancy of this species may increase with the conditions associated with migrated marsh, specifically greater C. jamaicense dominance and decreasing distance-to-forest. Clapper/king rail (Rallus crepitans/elegans) occupancy was greater at sites that had burned more frequently over the past decade, and occupancy of all focal taxa was greater in areas with vegetation conditions consistent with the effects of fire in coastal marshes, including reduced herbaceous vegetation density and shorter woody vegetation. As such, prescribed fire may serve as an effective method of facilitating marsh migration and increasing the quality and quantity of habitat for coastal marsh birds as sea-level rises. © 2019 The Authors.",2019,,Ecosphere,10,1,,,10.1002/ecs2.2555,,#15978,Taillie 2019,,
146,"Ice Sheets, Glaciers, and Sea Level","Allison, I.; Colgan, W.; King, M.; Paul, F.","Within the past 125,000. years, variations in Earth's climate have resulted in global sea levels fluctuating from 130 to 140. m lower than present day to 6 to 9. m higher. Presently, global mean sea level is rising at its fastest rate in the past 6,000. years (~3. mm/year). In this chapter, we discuss both the causes and implications of sea-level rise from the perspective of a cryospheric hazard. We also survey the best estimates of sea-level rise and cryospheric mass change from a variety of monitoring techniques. The transfer of terrestrial ice into the sea has contributed about 50 percent of the sea-level rise since 1993, and probably exceeded the combined sea-level changes due to thermal expansion, changes in terrestrial water storage, and changes in ocean basin size since 2003. This cryospheric contribution to sea-level rise is approximately equally split between the combined ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, and the global population of about 200,000 glaciers. The societal effects of sea-level rise will be highly varied throughout the world, with some locations experiencing relatve sea-level drop, whereas others experience a relative sea-level rise several times the global mean. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the sea-level rise due to terrestrial ice loss will be most substantial in areas furthest from the source of melting ice. Although this cryospheric hazard will unfold over a much longer time scale than many of the other hazards discussed in this volume, the ramifications of sea-level rise will likely be more widespread and profound.

148,Periodicity in Stem Growth and Litterfall in Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands: Influence of Salinity and Drought on Nitrogen Recycling,"Cormier, N.; Krauss, K.W.; Conner, W.H.","Many tidally influenced freshwater forested wetlands (tidal swamps) along the south Atlantic coast of the USA are currently undergoing dieback and decline. Salinity often drives conversion of tidal swamps to marsh, especially under conditions of regional drought. During this change, alterations in nitrogen (N) uptake from dominant vegetation or timing of N recycling from the canopy during annual litter senescence may help to facilitate marsh encroachment by providing for greater bioavailable N with small increases in salinity. To monitor these changes along with shifts in stand productivity, we established sites along two tidal swamp landscape transects on the lower reaches of the Waccamaw River (South Carolina) and Savannah River (Georgia) representing freshwater (≤0.1 psu), low oligohaline (1.1-1.6 psu), and high oligohaline (2.6-4.1 psu) stands; the latter stands have active marsh encroachment. Aboveground tree productivity was monitored on all sites through monthly litterfall collection and dendrometer band measurements from 2005 to 2009. Litterfall samples were pooled by season and analyzed for total N and carbon (C). On average between the two rivers, freshwater, low oligohaline, and high oligohaline tidal swamps returned 8,126, 3,831, and 1,471 mg N m-2 year-1, respectively, to the forest floor through litterfall, with differences related to total litterfall volume rather than foliar N concentrations. High oligohaline sites were most inconsistent in patterns of foliar N concentrations and N loading from the canopy. Leaf N content generally decreased and foliar C/N generally increased with salinization (excepting one site), with all sites being fairly inefficient in resorbing N from leaves prior to senescence. Stands with higher salinity also had greater flood frequency and duration, lower basal area increments, lower tree densities, higher numbers of dead or dying trees, and much reduced leaf litter fall (103 vs. 624 g m-2 year-1) over the five study years. Our data suggest that alternative processes, such as the rate of decomposition and potential for N mineralization, on tidal swamp sites undergoing salinity-induced state change may be more important for controlling N biogeochemical cycling in soils than differences among sites in N loading via litterfall. © 2012 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (outside the USA).",2013,,Estuar.

150,Saltwater intrusion induces shifts in soil microbial diversity and carbon use efficiency in a coastal grassland ecosystem,"Brown, R.W.; Rhymes, J.M.; Jones, D.L.","Salt accumulation and salinisation of coastal soils is a global issue. Further, climate change is likely to increase the amount of land affected by salinity due to the increasing frequency and severity of coastal flooding and brackish water ingress. The impact of this on the ability of soils to deliver ecosystem services, particularly carbon (C) storage, however, remains unclear. We hypothesized that coastal inundation would negatively affect C storage by lowering plant C inputs and by placing greater osmotic stress on the microbial community leading to a reduced C use efficiency (CUE). Here, we use a coastal grassland ecosystem, which is becoming increasingly subjected to sea and brackish water flooding, to explore the relationship between plant/microbial growth and CUE along a natural salinity gradient. To reflect steady state conditions, we traced the turnover and partitioning of a low (ambient) dose and high (growth stimulation) dose of 14C-labelled glucose into microbial anabolic and catabolic pools, from which microbial CUE was calculated. This was supported by measurements of the diversity of the bacterial community across the salinity gradient using 16S metabarcoding. Our results showed that coastal flooding significantly reduced plant growth (p < 0.005), increased soil C content (p < 0.05) and induced an increase in microbial CUE under low glucose-C conditions (p < 0.05). Conversely, no significant difference in CUE or microbial growth was apparent when a high glucose-C dose was used. Soil bacterial community alpha (α) diversity increased with soil salinity while beta (β) diversity also shifted in response to the higher saline conditions. Our analysis suggests that the largest impact of coastal flooding on soil C cycling was the inability of the plant community to adapt, leading to higher plant residue inputs as well as the decline in soil structure. Conversely, the microbial community had adapted to the increased salinity, resulting in only small changes in the uptake and metabolic partitioning of C. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Soil Biol.

152,Sea-level rise: Implications for water resources management,"Hay, J.E.; Mimura, N.","Globally, sea level has been rising for more than the last one hundred years, and is expected to do so into the foreseeable future, and at an accelerating rate. The direct influences of sea-level rise on water resources come principally from the following: new or accelerated coastal erosion; more extensive coastal inundation and higher levels of sea flooding; increases in the landward reach of sea waves and storm surges; seawater intrusion into surface waters and coastal aquifers; and further encroachment of tidal waters into estuaries and coastal river systems. The impacts of sea-level rise are likely to be felt disproportionately in certain areas, reflecting both natural and socio-economic factors that enhance the levels of risks. The opportunity to learn about the likely nature of, and most appropriate adaptation to, the anticipated impacts of sea-level rise on water resources is arguably best developed in rapidly subsiding coastal areas, and especially in low-lying deltas where subsidence rates are typically much larger than the historic rise in global mean sea level. Significantly, such areas are often major centres of population and of economic activity, thereby highlighting the human dimensions of sea-level rise. Sound management of the risks to water resources associated with sea-level rise requires enhancing adaptive capacity, mainstreaming adaptation, harmonizing responses to extreme events, variability and long-term change and strengthening regional and international cooperation and coordination.

Our study utilized established sites along salinity and flooding gradients in the United States of Georgia, Louisiana, and South Carolina. We hypothesized that environmental variables, namely salinity and water level, as well as distance between sites would be correlated with baldcypress-associated rhizosphere and root endosphere bacterial communities. We found that geographic distance correlated with rhizosphere but not root endosphere bacterial communities, suggesting that the trees may have stabilized their endosphere communities via recruitment of a more specific suite of taxa from the surrounding soil. Mean water level, mean salinity, and the volume of woody debris were associated with both endosphere and rhizosphere bacterial communities in baldcypress trees. The density of host trees was also associated with endosphere community composition. Our study is the first to use 16S Illumina sequencing to characterize bacterial communities in baldcypress trees— a key restoration species in coastal swamp ecosystems under threat from rising sea levels. © 2020, Society of Wetland Scientists.",2020,,Wetlands,40,6,2179-2188,,10.1007/s13157-020-01338-w,,#16478,Lumibao 2020,,
154,The importance of pulsed physical events for sustainability of Louisiana coastal forested wetlands,"Day, J.W.; Conner, W.H.; Shaffer, G.P.","A number of freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River into Louisiana's coastal wetlands are currently in operation or in the planning stage. These diversions have multiple objectives including maintaining a desirable salinity gradient, restoring deteriorating wetlands, and enhancing fisheries. The extensive freshwater forested wetlands surrounding the western end of Lake Pontchartrain receive little or no sediment input and are currently deteriorating due to continuous flooding. Diverting nutrient-rich water through wetlands can lead to substantial nutrient removal and to enhanced accretion. The objective of this paper is to compare the impacts on freshwater wetland ecology, accretion, and water quality of several scenarios for diverting freshwater from the Mississippi River. Accretion will be increased so that the area will become progressively less flooded, enhancing productivity and seedling recruitment. With overland flow, about 73% of N and 48% of P will be retained in the wetland, while other alternatives are estimated to remove 0-33% of N and 0-40% of P. Productivity of the forested wetland will decrease by at least 20-50% over the next 50 years if nothing is done, but there would be a substantial increase in productivity if river water is diverted into the area. We recommend that a 45-55 m3/s diversion be placed in the southern portion of the swamps of Lake Maurepas and that the diversion be operated annually from winter to early spring. There are indications that a diversion in late summer and fall would be beneficial, as that is when salt pulses typically occur.",2006,,Hydrol. Manage. For. Wetlands - Proc. Int.

155,"Baldcypress and water tupelo responses to insect defoliation and nutrient augmentation in Maurepas Swamp, Louisiana, USA","Effler, R.S.; Goyer, R.A.; Lenhard, G.J.","Forested wetlands in Louisiana are hydrologically isolated from the Mississippi River, impacted by saltwater intrusion, and are sinking, resulting in more frequent flooding for longer periods. These problems are exacerbated in some areas by impoundment from man-made structures. Additionally, defoliation of the two dominant trees, baldcypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.), frequently occur during spring. In Louisiana, the baldcypress leafroller, BCLR (Archips goyerana Kruse) and the forest tent caterpillar, FTC (Malacosoma disstria Hubner) annually defoliate an average of 120,000 ha of baldcypress-tupelo swamps. In combination, these factors have led to severely degraded forested wetlands with reduced basal area, dieback and tree mortality over extensive, formerly productive swamplands. Restoration plans call for reintroducing Mississippi River water by diversions, to increase sediment elevation, promote natural regeneration, and enhance primary and secondary productivity. Nutrient augmentation of baldcypress and water tupelo trees in Maurepas Swamps (similar to NO3- loading rates expected from 229 m3/s diversion) increased radial growth (cm2) of both species (especially baldcypress) in degraded forest stands. Nutrient augmentation also increased nitrogen in foliage (insect frass (feces), spring clipped leaves, and abscised leaf litter) for both tree species. Nitrogen content of canopy foliage and leaf litter was positively correlated with site health. These findings support hypotheses that swamps in southeastern Louisiana are nutrient limited, and existing trees can utilize, benefit, and act as nutrient sinks for nutrient-laden river water accompanying diversions. Defoliation of these swamp species, although not uniform among years, did not result in losses in radial growth, but increased overall litter deposition for baldcypress. An increase in nitrogen content in insect frass in response to nutrient augmentation indicates defoliator populations might increase as a result of nutrient influxes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Ten of the families were from coastal sites in Louisiana and Alabama, USA that have elevated levels of soil-water salinity. The other five families were from inland, freshwater sites in Louisiana. Seedlings from all families tolerated flooding with water of low (2 g l-1) salinity. Differences in biomass among families became most apparent at the highest salinity levels (6 and 8 g l-1). Overall, increasing salinity reduced leaf biomass more than root biomass, which in turn was reduced more than stem biomass. A subset of seedlings from the main greenhouse experiment was periodically placed indoors under artificial light, and measurements were made of gas exchange and leaf water potential. Also, tissue concentrations of Cl-, Na+, K+, and Ca2+ were determined at the end of the greenhouse experiment. Significant intraspecific variation was found for nearly all the physiological parameters evaluated, but only leaf concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were correlated with an index of family-level differences in salt tolerance.",1997,,Wetlands,17,2,310-320,,10.1007/BF03161419,,#16633,Allen 1997,,
157,"Vegetation Trends in a Restored Coastal Wetland at Prisoners Harbor, Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park","Power, P.J.; Denn, M.; Wagner, J.; Martin, M.","Prisoners Harbor on Santa Cruz Island, California, formerly supported a 5-ha wetland and riparian system, the largest on the California Channel Islands. During the late 1800s ranchers filled in about half of the wetland area in order to support ranching activities. They also rerouted the stream channel to the canyon edge and built an earthen berm along its west bank, which disconnected the stream from its floodplain. The National Park Service developed a wetland and riparian restoration design for Prisoners Harbor based on topographic and hydrologic analyses and on vegetation community depth-to-water-table relationships developed from neighboring reference wetlands. In 2011 Channel Islands National Park and The Nature Conservancy restored 1.25 ha of coastal wetlands by removing artificial fill and the earthen berm. Postproject vegetation monitoring during 2012 to 2016 showed increased abundance of 3 of the 8 herbaceous planted wetland species and declines in target invasive species. Severe drought conditions during this window likely influenced vegetation abundance. Postrestoration hydrologic monitoring showed that the restored marsh met the federal wetland hydrology standard only twice: once in late 2011 before the drought began and then again in January-September 2017. An exceptionally large swell and high tide during winter 2015/16 resulted in saltwater flooding of the site; salinity returned to more typical values only slowly after this event. Expansion of wetland species, even during a historic drought and atypical seawater intrusion, suggests that this evidence-based approach to restoration design will result in functional coastal wetland habitat as more typical precipitation levels return. However, we emphasize the need for aggressive control of nonnative plants until native plant cover is well established. © Brigham Young University 2018.",2018,,West. North Am.

Land-use activities associated with artificial drainage infrastructure (canals, ditches, and drains) could exacerbate saltwater exposure. However, studies assessing the effects of artificial drainage on the vulnerability of coastal landscapes to saltwater exposure are lacking. We examined the extent to which artificial drainage infrastructure has altered the potential for saltwater intrusion in the coastal plain of eastern North Carolina. Regional spatial analyses demonstrate that artificial drainages not only lower the overall elevation in coastal landscapes, but they also alter the routing and concentration of hydrological flows. Together, these factors have the potential to increase the total proportion of the landscape vulnerable to saltwater intrusion, not only in areas adjacent to drainage infrastructure but also in places where no artificial drainages exist due to large scale effects of flow rerouting. Among all land cover types in eastern North Carolina, wetlands are most vulnerable to saltwater exposure.

160,Adaptation as a potential response to sea-level rise: a genetic basis for salinity tolerance in populations of a coastal marsh fish,"Purcell, KM; Hitch, AT; Klerks, PL; Leberg, PL","Relative sea-level rise is resulting in the intrusion of saline waters into marshes historically dominated by fresh water. Saltwater intrusions can potentially affect resident marsh species, especially when storm-related tidal surges cause rapid changes in salinity. We examined the role of historical salinity exposure on the survival of Gambusia affinis from two locations in coastal Louisiana. At each location, we sampled fish populations from fresh, intermediate and brackish marshes. Individuals were then exposed to a salinity of 25 parts per thousand and survival time was measured. We found that fish from brackish and intermediate marshes had an increased tolerance to salinity stress relative to fish from freshwater environments. We then tested the descendents of fish from the fresh and brackish marshes, reared for two generation in fresh water, to determine if there was a genetic basis for differential survival. We found that descendents of individuals from brackish marshes showed elevated survivals relative to the descendents of fish with no historical exposure to salinity. The most reasonable mechanism to account for the differences in survival relative to historical exposure is genetic adaptation, suggesting that natural selection may play a role in the responses of resident marsh fishes to future increases in salinity.",2008,,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,1,1,155-160,WOS:000262783400013,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00001.x,,#17208,Purcell 2008,,
161,Interactive effects of hydrology and salinity on oligohaline plant species productivity: Implications of relative sea-level rise,"Spalding, EA; Hester, MW","Sea-level rise is anticipated to alter hydrologic and salinity regimes of coastal wetlands. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine species-level responses to 12 sea-level rise scenarios. Both hydrologic regime (-10, +5, and +20 cm flooding depth) and salinity level (fresh, 2%o, 4%o, and 6%o) were interactively manipulated. Within these various sea-level rise scenarios, we sought to determine the effects of hydrologic regime, salinity level, and the interaction of these two stresses on the productivity of Panicum hemitomon, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Spartina patens, which are dominant macrophytes of fresh, intermediate, and brackish marsh types, respectively, in coastal Louisiana and the southeastern coastal plain. We found that altered hydrologic regimes and increased salinity levels differentially affected edaphic conditions and species-level productivity. Increases in flooding depth were most detrimental to S. patens. Salinity levels greater than 4%o resulted in mortality of P. hemitomon, and salinity levels of 6%o resulted in reduced growth and eventual death of S. lancifolia. The effects of elevated salinity levels on P. hemitomon and S. lancifolia were exacerbated when coupled with increased flooding levels. Although soil organic matter was shown to increase in all vegetative conditions, increases were dependent upon the productivity of the species under the different hydrologic regimes and salinity levels with P. hemitomon displaying tremendous potential to increase soil organic matter under fresh conditions, especially when coupled with moderate flooding. The results of this study indicate that as plant communities are subjected to long-term changes in hydrology and salinity levels, community productivity and sustainability ultimately will be determined by species-level tolerances in conjunction with species interactions.",2007,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,30,2,214-225,WOS:000247075600002,10.1007/BF02700165,,#17349,Spalding 2007,,
162,Testing the interactive effects of flooding and salinity on tidal marsh plant productivity,"Buffington, KJ; Goodman, AC; Freeman, CM; Thorne, KM","Tidal wetlands support plant communities that facilitate carbon storage, accrete soil, and provide habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change.. We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change. This may be especially true for estuaries that currently have prolonged freshwater phases like those in the Pacific Northwest.",2020,,AQUATIC BOTANY,164,,,WOS:000535951000006,10.1016/j.aquabot.2020.103231,,#17381,Buffington 2020,,

Trees from estuarine reaches heavily intruded by saltwater flooding contained larger concentrations of chloride, bromide, and sodium than did trees from less intruded reaches. At three intruded sites, trees nearest open water contained larger concentrations of these elements within outermost sapwood rings than did trees farther from open water and presumably flooded less often. Chloride was translocated from outer to inner sapwood rings of saltwater-intruded trees, resulting in larger concentrations within heartwood than within the inner sapwood. Chloride concentrations along the heartwood radius were used to estimate the position of the heartwood-sapwood interface during the beginning stages of intrusion, thus permitting historical estimates of the local onset of intrusion. Element analysis of the wood of baldcypress may aid assessments of tree growth and mortality in regions already subjected to saline flooding, and in coastal forests at risk from predicted sea level rises.",1995,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,5,3,785-792,WOS:A1995RM90200022,10.2307/1941986,,#17407,YANOSKY 1995,,

We hypothesized that marsh elevation decreased rapidly following plant mortality because of structural collapse of the living root network. We monitored the elevation of 20 marsh hummocks between April 1990 and April 1992. Near total plant mortality occurred within 1 year and was attributed to excessive flooding. Hummock elevation decreased almost 15 cm within 2 years but elevation of adjacent ponds showed no trend. Plant stubble was still rooted in place on the submerged hummocks, and even slight evidence of surface erosion was not noted until the end of the study. The Cs-137 inventory in soil collected before and after the study also indicated that pest collapse rather than erosion caused the elevation decrease. Thus, pest collapse may initiate interior marsh ponds that subsequently spread via erosion and may partly explain why some marshes experiencing plant mortality convert to open water rather than re-vegetate. Feat collapse appeared to be the primary mechanism of marsh loss in this Louisiana hotspot.",1994,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,10,4,1021-1030,WOS:A1994PJ19000018,,,#17414,DELAUNE 1994,,
165,Effects of salinity and water level on coastal marshes: an experimental test of disturbance as a catalyst for vegetation change,"Baldwin, AH; Mendelssohn, IA","Wetlands in many coastal areas are threatened by sea level rise. Higher sea level will increase the frequency and duration of inundation in coastal areas and, in some systems, result in higher salinity as well. While the effects of salinity and water level on coastal marsh vegetation have been widely investigated, the role of disturbance in causing shifts in vegetation due to changes in salinity or water level has received little attention. We examined interactions of disturbance (clipping of aboveground vegetation) with salinity and water level treatments in a factorial arrangement using oligohaline marsh mesocosms. The mesocosms all contained soil and vegetation from two adjoining plant communities, one dominated by Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. and the other by Sagittaria lancifolia L. We assessed vegetation responses quarterly for 1 year and related responses to soil redox potential (E-h). sulfide concentration, salinity, and pH. We found that salinity and water level had significant effects on species richness only following disturbance and that similar patterns occurred for aboveground biomass of dominant and subdominant species. Following disturbance, aboveground biomass of Sagittaria lancifolia was significantly reduced by salinity but not by flooding (due to a capacity for seed germination under flooded conditions and rapid vegetative growth following disturbance), while the more salt-tolerant Spartina patens was eliminated by flooding but not affected by salinity. Disturbance led to almost complete eradication of vegetation under flooded, saline conditions. In the absence of disturbance, Sagittaria lancifolia biomass increased while Spartina patens was not affected in response to flooding, and neither species was significantly affected by salinity. Responses of vegetation corresponded with lower E-h in flooded and saline treatments and higher sulfide concentration in saline treatments. Our results suggest that disturbance is an important component of vegetation change in response to rising sea level, catalyzing rapid shifts in vegetation structure or accelerating wetland loss.

166,Saltwater reduces potential CO2 and CH4 production in peat soils from a coastal freshwater forested wetland,"Minick, KJ; Mitra, B; Noormets, A; King, JS","A major concern for coastal freshwater wetland function and health is the effects of saltwater intrusion on greenhouse gas production from peat soils. Coastal freshwater forested wetlands are likely to experience increased hydroperiod with rising sea level, as well as saltwater intrusion. These potential changes to wetland hydrology may also alter forested wetland structure and lead to a transition from forest to shrub/marsh wetland ecosystems. Loss of forested wetlands is already evident by dying trees and dead standing trees (""ghost"" forests) along the Atlantic coast of the US, which will result in significant alterations to plant carbon (C) inputs, particularly that of coarse woody debris, to soils. We investigated the effects of salinity and wood C inputs on soils collected from a coastal freshwater forested wetland in North Carolina, USA, and incubated in the laboratory with either freshwater or saltwater (2.5 or 5.0 ppt) and with or without the additions of wood. Saltwater additions at 2.5 and 5.0 ppt reduced CO2 production by 41% and 37 %, respectively, compared to freshwater. Methane production was reduced by 98% (wood-free incubations) and by 75%-87% (wood-amended incubations) in saltwater treatments compared to the freshwater plus wood treatment. Additions of wood also resulted in lower CH4 production from the freshwater treatment and higher CH4 production from saltwater treatments compared to wood-free incubations. The delta(CH4)-C-13-C isotopic signature suggested that, in wood-free incubations, CH4 produced from the freshwater treatment originated primarily from the acetoclastic pathway, while CH4 produced from the saltwater treatments originated primarily from the hydrogenotrophic pathway. These results suggest that saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater forested wetlands will reduce CH4 production, but long-term changes in C dynamics will likely depend on how changes in wetland vegetation and microbial function influence C cycling in peat soils.",2019,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,16,23,4671-4686,WOS:000502281100001,10.5194/bg-16-4671-2019,,#17471,Minick 2019,,

Our objective was to examine the effects of tidal flow restoration on denitrification potential and carbon (C) mineralization across an urban coastal landscape. Soil cores were collected from 32 tidal wetlands in Connecticut, U.S.A., spanning a wide range of salinity (0.3-29 ppt) and watershed development (<1-79%). In brackish wetlands, denitrification potential increased with time since restoration, while C mineralization showed no significant relationship. Soil chemistry was also a strong predictor of process rates; best fit multiple linear regression models for denitrification included both soil chemistry variables and time since restoration. Although principal components analysis revealed soil chemistry overlapped by wetland type (freshwater, saline, or brackish), process rates in freshwater versus brackish wetlands had different relationships with soil chemistry. In freshwater wetlands, denitrification potential and C mineralization increased with soil metal content. In brackish wetlands, denitrification potential decreased with increasing salinity and C mineralization increased with increasing organic matter, soil moisture, and ammonium.

168,Response and Recovery of Low-Salinity Marsh Plant Communities to Presses and Pulses of Elevated Salinity,"Li, F; Pennings, SC","In estuaries, future variation in sea level and river discharge will lead to saline intrusion into low-salinity tidal marshes. To investigate the processes that control the differential response and recovery of tidal freshwater marsh plant communities to saline pulses, a 3x5 factorial greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effects of a range of salinity levels (3, 5, and 10practical salinity units (PSU)) and pulse durations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 30days per month) on community composition of tidal freshwater marsh vegetation. Recovery of perturbed communities was also examined after 10months. The results showed that community composition was increasingly affected by the more-saline and longer-duration treatments. The increasing suppression of salt-sensitive species resulted in species reordering, decreased species richness, and decreased aboveground biomass. Most of the plant species were able to recover from low-salinity, short-duration saline pulses in less than 1year. However, because not all species recovered in the heavily salinized treatments, species richness at the end of the recovery period remained low for treatments that were heavily salinized during the treatment period. In contrast, plant aboveground biomass fully recovered in the heavily salinized treatments. Although the magnitude and duration of pulsed environmental changes had strong effects on community composition, shifts in community composition prevented long-term reductions in productivity. Thus, in this study system, environmental change affected species composition more strongly than it did ecosystem processes.",2019,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,42,3,708-718,WOS:000463827200008,10.1007/s12237-018-00490-1,,#17595,Li 2019,,

Increased flooding, nutrient and sediment deprivation, and salt-water intrusion have been implicated as probable causes of the decline of coastal swamps. We developed a two-species individual-based forest succession model to compare the growth and composition of a cypress-tupelo swamp under various combinations of flooding intensity and salinity levels, using historical time-series of stage and salinity data as inputs. Our model simulates forest succession over 500 years by representing the growth, mortality, and reproduction of individual Taxodium distichum (baldcypress) and Nyssa aquatica (water tupelo) trees in a 1-km(2) spatial grid of 1 m x 10 m cells that vary in water levels and salinity through differences in elevation. We independently adjusted the elevations of each cell to obtain different grid-wide mean elevations and standard deviations of elevation; this affected the temporal and spatial pattern of flooding. We calibrated the model by adjusting selected parameters until averaged basal area, stem density and wood production rates under two different mean elevations (partially versus highly flooded) were qualitatively similar to comparable values reported for swamps in the literature. Corroboration involved comparing model predictions to four well-monitored contrasting habitat sites within the Maurepas Basin, Louisiana, USA. Model predictions of both species combined showed the same patterns among sites as the data, but the model overestimated wood production and the dominance of T. distichum. Exploratory simulations predicted that increased flooding leads to swamps with reduced basal areas and stem densities, while increased salinity resulted in lower basal areas at low salinity concentration (similar to 1-3 psu) and complete tree mortality at higher salinity concentrations (similar to 2-6 psu). Our model can provide insight into the succession dynamics of coastal swamps and information for the effective design of restoration actions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because habitat loss is a measure of the risk of extinction, managers are keen for guidance to reduce risk posed by sea-level rise. Building upon standard inundation mapping techniques and suitability mapping, we develop a ranking system that models sea-level rise vulnerability as a function of six input parameters defined by wetland experts: type of inundation, time of inundation, soil type, habitat value, infrastructure, and coastal erosion. We apply this model under the mid-century and end-of-century RCP8.5 sea-level projection (0.30 m by 2057, and 0.74 m by 2100) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. To demonstrate this method, the model is applied to three coastal wetlands on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and O'ahu. Each ranked input parameter is mapped upon a 2 m horizontal resolution raster and final vulnerability is obtained by calculating the weighted geometric mean of the input vulnerability scores. Areas that ranked with the 'highest' vulnerability should be the focus of future management efforts.

173,GLOBAL SEA-RISE: AN EARLY WARNING,"Zambo, AA","One of the most important problems facing coastal communities today is the effects of a global sea-rise on coastline habitat and infrastructure. Such a rise could inundate lowlands and wetlands, erode beaches, and exacerbate coastal flooding. Furthermore, rising sea level can influence the rate of salt-water intrusion into coastal aquifers, cause expansion of the salt-water wedge in estuaries, and increase the probability of damage from storm surges along coastlines. Predicting shoreline retreat and land loss rates is critical to planning future coastal zone management strategies and assessing biological impacts due to changes in or destruction of habitat. To date long-term coastal planning has been done piecemeal, if at all (NRC, 1995). Consequently, facilities are being located and entire communities are being developed without consideration to the potential costs to relocate and/or protect them from the effects of sea-level rise, flooding, and/or loss of natural resources.An average rise in global ocean levels of just a few inches could have devastating effects on coastal towns, cities, and ecosystems worldwide. More than 100 million people live within I meter (3.28 feet) of the mean sea level (Douglas & Kearney, 2001). The problem is exceptionally urgent and serious for the low-lying small island nations of the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2006 that by 2100 the sea-level could rise as much as 0.58 meters (23 inches) (Solomon et al., 2007). Current estimates of sea-level rise by 2100 range between 0.30-0.91 meters (1-3 feet). The range reflects uncertainty about global temperature projections and how rapidly ice sheets will melt or slide into the ocean in response to the warmer temperatures.Regardless of the future uncertainty, the current rate of sea-level rise is more than double the average sea-level rise seen over the past few centuries. Equally alarming is the fact that the rate of sea-level rise appears to have increased exponentially over the past few decades.",2008,,JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING,3,1,14-23,WOS:000264995000002,10.3992/jgb.3.1.14,,#18399,Zambo 2008,,
174,Freshwater diversions as an ecosystem management tool for maintaining soil organic matter accretion in coastal marshes,"DeLaune, RD; Kongchum, M; White, JR; Jugsujinda, A",Marsh soil accretion processes were examined at 12 locations in fresh and brackish marshes in Louisiana's northern Barataria Basin estuary. Soil accretion rate determined from Cs-137 ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr(-1). Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m(-2) yr(-1) while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g M-2 yr(-1) Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1-2 mm yr(-1)) and significant local subsidence (similar to 10 mm yr(-1)). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

175,Water salinity and inundation control soil carbon decomposition during salt marsh restoration: An incubation experiment,"Wang, FM; Kroeger, KD; Gonneea, ME; Pohlman, JW; Tang, JW","Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.",2019,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,9,4,1911-1921,WOS:000461114900029,10.1002/ece3.4884,,#18833,Wang 2019,,

Tides, storm surges, rainfall, and salt intrusion affect infrastructure and human health. In case studies of Charleston, South Carolina, and Morehead City, North Carolina, USA, this project sought to advance risk assessment of urban water and wastewater infrastructure and identify linkages to human health impacts as risk evolves with sea level rise. The methodology integrates community infrastructure, health care, emergency resources, geospatial simulation, and a tabletop exercise with planners, emergency managers, public utilities, and health care providers. Resilience is assessed by community participants using interactive online maps, susceptibility indices, and a resilience matrix.

177,Simulated storm surge effects on freshwater coastal wetland soil porewater salinity and extractable ammonium levels: Implications for marsh recovery after storm surge,"McKee, M; White, JR; Putnam-Duhon, LA","Coastal wetland systems experience both short-term changes in salinity, such as those caused by wind driven tides and storm surge, and long-term shifts caused by sea level rise. Salinity increases associated with storm surge are known to have significant effects on soil porewater chemistry, but there is little research on the effect of flooding length on salt penetration depth into coastal marsh soils. A simulated storm surge was imposed on intact soil columns collected from a non-vegetated mudflat and a vegetated marsh site in the Wax Lake Delta, LA. Triplicate intact cores were continuously exposed to a 35 salinity water column (practical salinity scale) for 1, 2, and 4 weeks and destructively sampled in order to measure porewater salinity and extractable NH4-N at two cm depth intervals. Salinity was significantly higher in the top 8 cm for both the marsh and mudflat cores after one week of flooding. After four weeks of flooding, salinity was significantly higher in marsh and mudflat cores compared to the control (no salinity) cores throughout the profile for both sites. Extractable ammonium levels increased significantly in the marsh cores throughout the experiment, but there was only a marginally (p < 0.1) significant increase seen in the mudflat cores. Results indicate that porewater salinity levels can become significantly elevated within a coastal marsh soil in just one week. This vertical intrusion of salt can potentially negatively impact macrophytes and associated microbial communities for significantly longer term post storm surge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

178,Biogeochemical Recovery of Oligohaline Wetland Soils Experiencing a Salinity Pulse,"Kiehn, WM; Mendelssohn, IA; White, JR","Oligohaline wetlands exist at a dynamic interface along a river-to-estuary gradient where salinity changes frequently due to fluctuating tidal cycles and weather events. Large storms can cause short-term saltwater intrusion into these low-lying coastal areas, exposing oligohaline wetland plants and soils to above-normal salinities and severe stress on wetland organisms. The objective of this study was to determine how oligohaline wetland soils respond to a single pulse saltwater intrusion, similar to what may occur during hurricane-associated storm surge. Soil response variables were measured in intrusion-Impacted and Reference soils before, during, and after a 6-wk saltwater intrusion event to determine potential impacts on microbial biomass and activity and associated nutrient dynamics. We observed no significant change in basal CO2 or CH4 production in oligohaline soils (interstitial salinity = 1.3 +/- 0.1 practical salinity units [psu]; mean +/- 1 SD) exposed to 20 psu saltwater, while substrate-induced methanogenesis was negatively correlated with salinity. Microbial biomass C (MBC) responded positively to saltwater intrusion by doubling in concentration at the 0- to 5-cm depth interval. Saltwater intrusion had no impact on porewater nutrient concentrations; however, extractable NH4+ decreased as salinity increased. Although some significant changes in microbial activity, abundance, and nutrient availability occurred due to saltwater intrusion, these impacts were generally transient, with post-intrusion conditions resembling pre-intrusion conditions. These results suggest that short-term and transient saltwater intrusion may have little longer-term effect on wetland soil biogeochemistry. However, compounding effects of frequent saltwater intrusion pulses due to strong, regularly occurring storm events could cause longer-lasting shifts in biogeochemical functioning of these wetlands.",2013,,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,77,6,2205-2215,WOS:000327024500032,10.2136/sssaj2013.05.0202,,#19478,Kiehn 2013,,
179,INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE RESPONSE OF TAXODIUM-DISTICHUM SEEDLINGS TO SALINITY,"ALLEN, JA; CHAMBERS, JL; MCKINNEY, D","Seedlings of 15 open-pollinated families of baldcypress (Taxodium disfichum) were tested for their tolerance to combined salinity and flooding stress. Ten of the families were from coastal locations in Louisiana or Alabama, USA, that were slightly brackish. The other families were from locations not affected by saltwater intrusion. Five salinity levels were investigated - 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 g l(-1) artificial seawater - all with flooding to approximately 5 cm above the soil surface. Survival, height growth, leaf area and total biomass all declined with increasing salinity. Significant variation was found among salinity levels, families, and salinity X family interactions for leaf area and total biomass. Two tolerance indices were also developed to compare family response with salinity. In general, families from brackish sources had greater total biomass, leaf area, and tolerance index values than families from freshwater sources at the higher salinity levels. A selection and breeding program designed to develop moderately salt-tolerant baldcypress seedlings for use in wetland restoration projects and other applications appears to be well-justified.",1994,,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,70,1-3,203-214,WOS:A1994QC19900018,10.1016/0378-1127(94)90087-6,,#19480,ALLEN 1994,,
180,Small gradients in salinity have large effects on stand water use in freshwater wetland forests,"Duberstein, JA; Krauss, KW; Baldwin, MJ; Allen, ST; Conner, WH; Salter, JS; Miloshis, M","Salinity intrusion is responsible for changes to freshwater wetland watersheds globally, but little is known about how wetland water budgets might be influenced by small increments in salinity. We studied a forested wetland in South Carolina, USA, and installed sap flow probes on 72 trees/shrubs along a salinity gradient. Species investigated included the trees baldcypress (Taxodium distichum [L.] Rich.), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.), swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora Walt.), and the shrub waxmyrtle (Morella cerifera (L.) Small). This study improves upon past reliance on greenhouse seedling studies by adding measurements of trees/shrubs along a salinity gradient, and better describes the role of low salinity on water use in freshwater wetland forests. We measured patterns of water use related to salinity, atmospheric conditions and season, and hypothesized that salinity would influence wetland forest water use through two mechanisms: salinity disturbances would yield stands with species and size classes that transpire less and individual trees with less conductive xylem tissue (i.e., sapwood). Both hypotheses held. At salinity concentrations ranging from fresh to 3 psu, forest structural changes alone resulted in stand water use reductions from 494 mm year(-1) in freshwater stands to 316 mm year(-1) in stands of slightly higher salinity. Tree sapwood function (inferred from radial sap flux profiles) also changed along this gradient and reduced sap flow rates by an additional 13.3% per unit increase in salinity (psu). Thus, stand water use was further reduced to 190 mm year(-1) on saline sites. We found that forest structure is not the only change that affects water use in salinized watersheds; individual tree eco-physiological responses to salinity, manifesting in different radial sap flow profiles, are important as well.",2020,,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,473,,,WOS:000551979700034,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118308,,#19669,Duberstein 2020,,
181,Structure and composition of oligohaline marsh plant communities exposed to salinity pulses,"Howard, RJ; Mendelssohn, IA","The response of two oligohaline marsh macrophyte communities to pulses of increased salinity was studied over a single growing season in a greenhouse experiment. The plant communities were allowed a recovery period in freshwater following the pulse events. The experimental treatments included: (1) salinity influx rate (rate of salinity increase from 0 to 12 g l(-1)); (2) duration of exposure to elevated salinity; and (3) water depth. The communities both included Sagittaria lancifolia L,; the codominant species were Eleocharis palustris (L.) Roemer and J.A. Schultes in community 1 and Schoenoplectus americanus (Pers.) Volk. ex Schinz and R. Keller in community 2. Effects of the treatments on sediment chemical characteristics (salinity, pH, redox potential, and sulfide and ammonium concentrations) and plant community attributes (aboveground and belowground biomass, stem density, leaf tissue nutrients, and species richness) were examined.The treatment effects often interacted to influence sediment and plant communities characteristics following recovery in fresh water. Salinity influx rate per se, however, had little effect on the abiotic or biotic response variables; significant influx effects were found when the 0 g l(-1) (zero influx) treatment was compared to the 12 g l(-1) treatments, regardless of the rate salinity was raised. A salinity level of 12 g l(-1) had negative effects on plant community structure and composition; these effects were usually associated with 3 months of salinity exposure. Water depth often interacted with exposure duration, but increased water depth did independently decrease the values of some community response measures.Community 1 was affected more than community 2 in the most extreme salinity treatment (3 months exposure/15-cm water depth). Although species richness in both communities was reduced, structural changes were more dramatic in community 1. Biomass and stem density were reduced in community 1 overall and in both dominant species. Structural changes in community 2 consisted of reduced biomass and stem density in the community overall and in S. lancifolia; S. americanus was not affected by salinity. in this most extreme treatment, community 2 tended to change to a monospecific S. americanus stand while community 1 was reduced to a few surviving stems of secondary species. Our results suggest that vegetation recovery or establishment of new species following a temporary increase in soil water salinity will vary with exposure duration and water depth.

182,"Constrained tree growth and gas exchange of seawater-exposed forests in the Pacific Northwest, USA","Wang, WZ; McDowell, NG; Ward, ND; Indivero, J; Gunn, C; Bailey, VL","Rising sea levels under climate change may have significant impacts on coastal vegetation dynamics, yet the response of coastal forest growth, gas exchange and survival to seawater intrusion remains poorly documented. We conducted a dendroecology study across six sites in western Washington, USA, to examine how tree growth, gas exchange (indexed by basal area increment (BAI) and wood delta C-13 respectively), and survival varies with seawater exposure through two approaches. First, tree core samples were collected at a site where seawater exposure started only 4 years prior to sampling, which allowed a cause-and-effect test of the impacts of seawater exposure on trees, and second, samples were collected at five additional sites where we compared downstream to upstream trees under current sea-level conditions. At the seawater intrusion site, BAI and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in the year of intrusion (2014) and stayed unchanged thereafter. Four years later (2018), the percentage of recently standing dead trees in the forest was 73.0% of the basal area. Across the regional assessment, percentage of standing dead trees was significantly greater in downstream than upstream forests at five of the six sites (averaged 37.7 +/- 11.0% and 4.3 +/- 2.1% basal area for downstream and upstream, respectively). Growth was significantly lower (p < 0.01) at the downstream than upstream for five sites, and Delta was lower for all needle-leaf trees (three sites) on the downstream compared to the upstream, but no difference was observed between downstream and upstream for broad-leaf trees (three sites). Synthesis. Combined both the cause-and-effect manipulative study and the regional assessment demonstrate that seawater exposure drives reductions in growth, decreased Delta of needle-leaf trees, increased mortality and greater climate sensitivity, regardless of whether the seawater exposure is recent or long-term.",2019,,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,107,6,2541-2552,WOS:000491025800003,10.1111/1365-2745.13225,,#20075,Wang 2019,,
183,"Vegetation trends in a restored coastal wetland at Prisoners Harbor, Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park","Power, PJ; Denn, M; Wagner, J; Martin, M","Prisoners Harbor on Santa Cruz Island, California, formerly supported a 5-ha wetland and riparian system, the largest on the California Channel Islands. During the late 1800s ranchers filled in about half of the wetland area in order to support ranching activities. They also rerouted the stream channel to the canyon edge and built an earthen berm along its west bank, which disconnected the stream from its floodplain. The National Park Service developed a wetland and riparian restoration design for Prisoners Harbor based on topographic and hydrologic analyses and on vegetation community depth-to-water-table relationships developed from neighboring reference wetlands. In 2011 Channel Islands National Park and The Nature Conservancy restored 1.25 ha of coastal wetlands by removing artificial fill and the earthen berm. Postproject vegetation monitoring during 2012 to 2016 showed increased abundance of 3 of the 8 herbaceous planted wetland species and declines in target invasive species. Severe drought conditions during this window likely influenced vegetation abundance. Postrestoration hydrologic monitoring showed that the restored marsh met the federal wetland hydrology standard only twice: once in late 2011 before the drought began and then again in January-September 2017. An exceptionally large swell and high tide during winter 2015/16 resulted in saltwater flooding of the site; salinity returned to more typical values only slowly after this event. Expansion of wetland species, even during a historic drought and atypical seawater intrusion, suggests that this evidence-basal approach to restoration design will result in functional coastal wetland habitat as more typical precipitation levels return. However, we emphasize the need for aggressive control of nonnative plants until native plant cover is well established.",2019,,WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST,78,4,644-651,WOS:000459312100008,10.3398/064.078.0408,,#20255,Power 2019,,
